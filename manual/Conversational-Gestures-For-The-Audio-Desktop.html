<p>By 1996, Emacspeak was the only piece of adaptive technology I
used; in fall of 1995, I had moved to Adobe Systems from DEC
Research to focus on enhancing the Portable Document Format (PDF)
to make PDF content repurposable. Between 1996 and 1998, I was
primarily focused on electronic document formats  &mdash;  I took this
opportunity to step back and evaluate what I had built as an
auditory interface within Emacspeak. This retrospect proved
extremely useful in gaining a sense of perspective and led to
formalizing the high-level concept of <em>Conversational Gestures</em>
and structured browsing/searching as a means of thinking about
user interfaces.
</p>
<p>By now, Emacspeak was a complete environment  &mdash;  I formalized what
it provided under the moniker <em>Complete Audio Desktop</em>. The fully
integrated user experience allowed me to move forward with
respect to defining interaction models that were highly optimized
to eyes-free interaction  &mdash;  as an example, see how Emacspeak
interfaces with modes like <strong>dired</strong> (Directory Editor) for
browsing and manipulating the filesystem, or <strong>proced</strong> (Process
Editor) for browsing and manipulating running processes. Emacs&rsquo;
integration with <strong>ispell</strong> for spell checking, as well as its
various completion facilities ranging from minibuffer completion
to other forms of dynamic completion while typing text provided
more opportunities for creating innovative forms of eyes-free
interaction. With respect to what had gone before (and is still
par for the course as far as traditional screen-readers are
concerned), these types of highly dynamic interfaces present a
challenge. For example, consider handling a completion interface
using a screen-reader that is speaking the visual display. There
is a significant challenge in deciding <em>what to speak</em> e.g., when
presented with a list of completions, the currently typed text,
and the default completion, which of these should you speak, and
in what order? The problem gets harder when you consider that the
underlying semantics of these items is generally not available
from examining the visual presentation in a consistent manner. By
having direct access to the underlying information being
presented, Emacspeak had a leg up with respect to addressing the
higher-level question  &mdash;  when you do have access to this
information, how do you present it effectively in an eyes-free
environment? For this and many other cases of dynamic
interaction, a combination of audio formatting, auditory icons,
and the ability to synthesize succinct messages from a
combination of information items  &mdash;  rather than having to forcibly
speak each item as it is rendered visually provided for highly
efficient eyes-free interaction.
</p>

<p>This was also when I stepped back to build out Emacspeak&rsquo;s table
browsing facilities  &mdash;  see the online Emacspeak documentation for
details on Emacspeak&rsquo;s table browsing functionality which
continues to remain one of the richest collection of end-user
affordances for working with two-dimensional data.

  <h2 class="chapter">14 TTS Servers</h2>
  <p>Emacspeak produces spoken output by communicating with one of
  many speech servers. This section documents the communication
  protocol between the client application i.e. Emacspeak, and the
  <acronym title="Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> (Text to Speech)
  server. This section is primarily intended for developers wishing
  to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create new speech servers that comply with this
    communication protocol</li>
    <li>Developers of other client applications who wish to use the
    various Emacspeak speech servers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For additional notes on how to log and view <acronym title=
  "Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> server commands when developing a
  speech server, see <a href=
  "http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2015/04/howto-log-speech-server-output-to-aid.html">
  http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2015/04/howto-log-speech-server-output-to-aid.html</a>.</p><span id="High_002dlevel-Overview"></span>
  <h3 class="section">14.1 High-level Overview</h3>
  <p>The <acronym title="Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> server reads
  commands from standard input, and script <em>speech-server</em>
  can be used to cause a <acronym title=
  "Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> server to communicate via a
  <acronym>TCP</acronym> socket. Speech server commands are used by
  the client application to make specific requests of the server;
  the server listens for these requests in a non-blocking read loop
  and executes requests as they become available. Requests can be
  classified as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Commands that send text to be spoken.</li>
    <li>Commands that set <em>state</em> of the <acronym title=
    "Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> server.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All commands are of the form</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">commandWord {arguments}
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>The braces are optional if the command argument contains no
  white space. The speech server maintains a <em>current state</em>
  that determines various characteristics of spoken output such as
  speech rate, punctuations mode etc. (see set of commands that
  manipulate speech state for complete list). The client
  application <em>queues</em> The text and non-speech audio output
  to be produced before asking the server to <em>dispatch</em> the
  set of queued requests, i.e. start producing output.</p>
  <p>Once the server has been asked to produce output, it removes
  items from the front of the queue, sends the requisite commands
  to the underlying <acronym title="Text to Speech">TTS</acronym>
  engine, and waits for the engine to acknowledge that the request
  has been completely processed. This is a non-blocking operation,
  i.e., if the client application generates additional requests,
  these are processed <em>immediately</em>.</p>
  <p>The above design allows the Emacspeak <acronym title=
  "Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> server to be <em>highly</em>
  responsive; Client applications can queue large amounts of text
  (typically queued a clause at a time to achieve the best
  prosody), ask the <acronym title="Text to Speech">TTS</acronym>
  server to start speaking, and interrupt the spoken output at any
  time.</p><span id="Commands-That-Queue-Output_002e"></span>
  <h4 class="subsection">14.1.1 Commands That Queue Output.</h4>
  <p>This section documents commands that either produce spoken
  output, or queue output to be produced on demand. Commands that
  place the request on the queue are clearly marked.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">version
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Speaks the <em>version</em> of the <acronym title=
  "Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> engine. Produces output
  immediately.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">tts_say text
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Speaks the specified <em>text</em> immediately. The text is
  not pre-processed in any way, contrast this with the primary way
  of speaking text which is to queue text before asking the server
  to process the queue.</p>
  <p>Note that this command needs to handle the special syntax for
  morpheme boundaries ‘<samp>[*]</samp>’. The ‘<samp>[*]</samp>’
  syntax is specific to the Dectalk family of synthesizers; servers
  for other <acronym title="Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> engines
  need to map this pattern to the engine-specific code for each
  engine. As an example, see <samp>servers/outloud</samp> A
  morpheme boundary results in synthesizing compound words such as
  <em>left bracket</em> with the right intonation; using a space
  would result in that phrase being synthesized as two separate
  words.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">l c
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Speak <em>c</em> a single character, as a letter. The
  character is spoken immediately. This command uses the
  <acronym title="Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> engine’s capability
  to speak a single character with the ability to flush speech
  <em>immediately</em>. Client applications wishing to produce
  character-at-a-time output, e.g., when providing character echo
  during keyboard input should use this command.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">d
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>This command is used to <em>dispatch</em> all queued requests.
  It was renamed to a single character command (like many of the
  commonly used <acronym title="Text to Speech">TTS</acronym>
  server commands) to work more effectively over slow (9600) dialup
  lines. The effect of calling this command is for the
  <acronym title="Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> server to start
  processing items that have been queued via earlier requests.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">tts_pause
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>This pauses speech <em>immediately</em>. It does not affect
  queued requests; when command <em>tts_resume</em> is called, the
  output resumes at the point where it was paused. Not all
  <acronym title="Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> engines provide
  this capability.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">tts_resume
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Resume spoken output if it has been paused earlier.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">s
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Stop speech <em>immediately</em>. Spoken output is
  interrupted, and all pending requests are flushed from the
  queue.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">q text
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Queues text to be spoken. No spoken output is produced until a
  <em>dispatch</em> request is received via execution of command
  <em>d</em>.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">c codes
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Queues synthesis codes to be sent to the <acronym title=
  "Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> engine. Codes are sent to the
  engine with no further transformation or processing. The codes
  are inserted into the output queue and will be dispatched to the
  <acronym title="Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> engine at the
  appropriate point in the output stream.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">a filename
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Cues the audio file identified by filename for playing.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">t freq length
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Queues a tone to be played at the specified frequency and
  having the specified length. Frequency is specified in hertz and
  length is specified in milliseconds.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">sh duration
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Queues the specified duration of silence. Silence is specified
  in milliseconds.</p><span id="Commands-That-Set-State"></span>
  <h4 class="subsection">14.1.2 Commands That Set State</h4>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">tts_reset
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Reset <acronym title="Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> engine to
  default settings.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">tts_set_punctuations mode
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Sets <acronym title="Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> engine to
  the specified punctuation mode. Typically, <acronym title=
  "Text to Speech">TTS</acronym> servers provide at least three
  modes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>None: Do not speak punctuation characters.</li>
    <li>Some: Speak some punctuation characters. Used for English
    prose.</li>
    <li>All: Speak out <em>all</em> punctuation characters; useful
    in programming modes.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">tts_set_speech_rate rate
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Sets speech rate. The interpretation of this value is
  typically engine specific.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">tts_set_character_scale factor
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Scale factor applied to speech rate when speaking individual
  characters.Thus, setting speech rate to 500 and character scale
  to 1.2 will cause command <em>l</em> to use a speech rate of
  <em>500 * 1.2 = 600</em>.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">tts_split_caps flag
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Set state of <em>split caps</em> processing. Turn this on to
  speak mixed-case (<acronym>AKA</acronym> Camel Case)
  identifiers.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">tts_capitalize flag
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Indicate capitalization.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">tts_allcaps flag
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Setting this flag precedes upper-case words with a
  <em>ac</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="section">16.13 Social Web — EMail, Instant
    Messaging, Blogging And Tweeting Using Open Protocols</h3>
    <p>The ability to process large amounts of email and electronic
    news has always been a feature of Emacs. I started using
    package <strong>vm</strong> for email in 1990, along with
    <strong>gnus</strong> for Usenet access many years before
    developing Emacspeak. So these were the first major packages
    that Emacspeak speech-enabled. Being able to access the
    underlying data structures used to visually render email
    messages and Usenet articles enabled Emacspeak to produce rich,
    succinct auditory output — this vastly increased my ability to
    consume and organize large amounts of information. Toward the
    turn of the century, instant messaging arrived in the
    mainstream — package <strong>tnt</strong> provided an Emacs
    implementation of a chat client that could communicate with
    users on the then popular AOL Instant Messenger platform. At
    the time, I worked at IBM Research, and inspired by package
    <strong>tnt</strong>, I created an Emacs client called
    <strong>ChatterBox</strong> using the Lotus Sametime API — this
    enabled me to communicate with colleagues at work from the
    comfort of Emacs. Packages like <strong>vm</strong>,
    <strong>gnus</strong>, <strong>tnt</strong> and
    <strong>ChatterBox</strong> provide an interesting example of
    how availability of a clean underlying API to a specific
    service or content stream can encourage the creation of
    efficient (and different) user interfaces. The touchstone of
    such successful implementations is a simple test — can the user
    of a specific interface tell if the person whom he is
    communicating with is also using the same interface? In each of
    the examples enumerated above, a user at one end of the
    communication chain cannot tell, and in fact shouldn’t be able
    to tell what client the user at the other end is using.
    Contrast this with closed services that have an inherent
    <em>lock-in</em> model e.g., proprietary word processors that
    use undocumented serialization formats — for a fun read, see
    this write-up on <a href=
    "http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/publications/colored-paper.html">
    Universe Of Fancy Colored Paper</a>.</p>
    <p>Today, my personal choice for instant messaging is the open
    Jabber platform. I connect to Jabber via Emacs package
    <strong>emacs-jabber</strong> and with Emacspeak providing a
    light-weight wrapper for generating the eyes-free interface, I
    can communicate seamlessly with colleagues and friends around
    the world.</p>
    <p>As the Web evolved to encompass ever-increasing swathes of
    communication functionality that had already been available on
    the Internet, we saw the world move from Usenet groups to
    <strong>Blogs</strong> — I remember initially dismissing the
    blogging phenomenon as just a re-invention of Usenet in the
    early days. However, mainstream users flocked to Blogging, and
    I later realized that blogging as a publishing platform brought
    along interesting features that made communicating and
    publishing information <strong>much</strong> easier. In 2005, I
    joined Google; during the winter holidays that year, I
    implemented a light-weight client for Blogger that became the
    start of Emacs package <strong>g-client</strong> — this package
    provides Emacs wrappers for Google services that provide a
    RESTful API.</p>

    Outline Editing <a class="copiable-link" href=
    "#Outline-Editing-1">¶</a></span></h4>
    <p>All of the various outline editing interfaces on the Emacs
    desktop allow the user to <strong class="strong">hide</strong>
    or <strong class="strong">show</strong> the contents at the
    different levels of a possibly nested tree structure.
    Components of this tree structure can be manipulated as a unit,
    e.g., entire subtrees can be deleted or copied. Outline editing
    thus provides an efficient means of obtaining quick overviews
    of a document.</p>
    <p>The visual interface displays such hidden content as a
    series of ellipses following the visible outline heading.
    Emacspeak produces auditory icon <strong class=
    "strong">ellipses</strong> when speaking such outline
    headings.</p>
    <p>The basic <strong class="strong">outline mode</strong>
    allows the user to specify the syntax and level of outline
    header lines as a regular expression. This simple technique can
    be used to advantage in the structured navigation of large
    electronic texts such as those available on the Internet from
    online book projects such as project Gutenberg and the Internet
    Wiretap. For example, when this feature is activated while
    reading the electronic text of a Shakespearean play, the
    different acts can be recognized as separate nodes in the
    logical structure of the document. The user can then hide the
    document body with a single keystroke, navigate the outline
    headings to find a particular act, and have that portion
    rendered either visually or aurally. Hiding an outline level
    produces auditory icon <strong class=
    "strong">close-object</strong>; exposing a hidden level
    produces auditory icon <strong class=
    "strong">open-object</strong>. For details on using mode
    <code class="code">outline</code>, see the relevant section of
    the online Emacs info manual.</p>
    <p>The basic outline facility described above is applicable to
    all content being edited or browsed on the Emacspeak desktop.
    In addition, Emacspeak has other specialized outline editing
    modes such as <strong class="strong">folding mode</strong> that
    provide extended outlining facilities. In mode <strong class=
    "strong">folding</strong>, the user can create (possibly
    nested) <strong class="strong">folds</strong> — logical
    containers of content that are delimited by a special
    <strong class="strong">fold mark</strong>. The fold mark is
    typically a text string that is chosen based on the type of
    content that is being manipulated. Thus, when <strong class=
    "strong">folding</strong> a C~program source file, fold marks
    are created from C~comments. The user can <strong class=
    "strong">open</strong> or <strong class="strong">close</strong>
    any or all folds in a document, and these actions are
    accompanied by auditory icons <strong class=
    "strong">open-object</strong> and <strong class=
    "strong">close-object</strong>. By entering a fold, all editing
    actions are restricted to the contents of that fold; this
    proves a simple yet convenient way of constraining editing
    actions such as search and replace to specific portions of
    large documents. Folds can be manipulated as a unit and can be
    deleted, copied or moved.</p>
    <p>Mode <strong class="strong">folding</strong> proves
    especially effective in maintaining large software modules. The
    technique can be used to advantage by creating folds for
    different sections in a module and by further placing each
    function appearing in a particular section in a fold of its
    own. Complex functions can themselves be folded into sections
    where each section reflects a different stage in the algorithm
    implemented by that function. Thus, the technique of folding
    can be used as an effective aid in <strong class=
    "strong">literate</strong> programming. I typically write
    software modules by first creating an outline structure using
    folds that reflect the various components of that module. Next,
    I populate each fold with the function signatures and
    documentation for the functions in each section. When I am
    satisfied with the overall architecture of the module, I fill
    in the function skeletons with actual program code. This
    technique is used extensively in maintaining the Emacspeak code
    base.</p>

@node dtk-speak
@section dtk-speak




Commentary:
Defines the TTS interface.



Automatically generated documentation
for commands defined in module  dtk-speak.



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-add-cleanup-pattern nil
@kbd{ control e d a }

Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that
are cleaned up.  Optional interactive prefix arg deletes
this pattern if previously added.  Cleaning up repeated
patterns results in emacspeak speaking the pattern followed
by a repeat count instead of speaking all the characters
making up the pattern.  Thus, by adding the repeating
pattern `.' (this is already added by default) emacspeak
will say ``aw fifteen dot'' when speaking the string
``...............'' instead of ``period period period period
''
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-pause nil
@kbd{ control e p }

Pause ongoing speech.
The speech can be resumed with command `dtk-resume'
normally bound to M-x dtk-resume.  Pausing speech is useful when one needs to
perform a few actions before continuing to read a large document.  Emacspeak
gives you speech feedback as usual once speech has been paused.  `dtk-resume'
continues the interrupted speech irrespective of the buffer
in which it is executed.
Optional PREFIX arg flushes any previously paused speech.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-reset-state nil
@kbd{ control e d  cap R  }

Restore sanity to the Dectalk.
Typically used after the Dectalk has been power   cycled.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-resume nil
Resume paused speech.
This command resumes  speech that has been suspended by executing
command `dtk-pause' bound to C-e p.
If speech has not been paused,
and option `dtk-resume-should-toggle' is set,
 then this command will pause ongoing speech.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-select-server nil
@kbd{ control e d d }

Select a speech server interactively.
Argument PROGRAM specifies the speech server program.
When called  interactively, The selected server is started immediately. 
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-character-scale nil
@kbd{ control e d f }

Set scale FACTOR for   speech rate.
Speech rate is scaled by this factor
when speaking characters.
Interactive PREFIX arg means set   the global default value, and then set the
current local  value to the result.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-chunk-separator-syntax nil
@kbd{ control e d RETURN }

Interactively set how text is split in chunks.
See the Emacs documentation on syntax tables for details on how characters are
classified into various syntactic classes.
Argument S specifies the syntax class.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-language nil
Set language according to the argument lang.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-next-language nil

@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-predefined-speech-rate nil
@kbd{ control e d 0   control e d 1   control e d 2   control e d 3   control e d 4   control e d 5   control e d 6   control e d 7   control e d 8   control e d 9 }

Set speech rate to one of nine predefined levels.
Interactive PREFIX arg says to set the rate globally.
Formula used is:
rate = dtk-speech-rate-base + dtk-speech-rate-step * level.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-preferred-language nil
Set the alias of the preferred language:
For example if alias="en" lang="en_GB",
then the following call:
 dtk-set-language("en")
will set "en_GB".

@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-previous-language nil
Switch to the previous available language
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-punctuations nil
@kbd{ control e d p }

Set punctuation mode to MODE.
Possible values are `some', `all', or `none'.
Interactive PREFIX arg means set   the global default value, and then set the
current local  value to the result.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-punctuations-to-all nil
Set punctuation  mode to all.
Interactive PREFIX arg sets punctuation mode globally.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-punctuations-to-some nil
Set punctuation  mode to some.
Interactive PREFIX arg sets punctuation mode globally.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-rate nil

when set, allcaps words  are  indicated by a
short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
value, and then set the current local value to the result.
Note that allcaps-beep is a very useful thing when programming.
However it is irritating to have it on when reading documents.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-capitalization nil
@kbd{ control e d c }

Toggle capitalization.
when set, capitalization is indicated by a
short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
value, and then set the current local value to the result.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-debug nil
@kbd{ control e d b }

Toggle state of the debug FLAG.
When debugging is on, you can switch to the buffer
*speaker* to examine the output from the process
that talks to the speech device by using command C-e d C-M-b.
Note: *speaker* is a hidden buffer, ie it has a leading space in its name.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-punctuation-mode nil
@kbd{ <delete>   control e d , }

Toggle punctuation mode between "some" and "all".
Interactive PREFIX arg makes the new setting global.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-quiet nil
@kbd{ control e d q }

value, and then set the current local value to the result.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-split-caps nil
@kbd{ control e d s }

Toggle split caps mode.
Split caps mode is useful when reading
Hungarian notation in program source code.  Interactive PREFIX arg
means toggle the global default value, and then set the current local
value to the result.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space nil
@kbd{ control e d SPACE }

Toggle splitting of speech on white space.
This affects the internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split
text purely by clause boundaries, or also include
whitespace.  By default, emacspeak sends a clause at a time
to the speech device.  This produces fluent speech for
normal use.  However in modes such as `shell-mode' and some
programming language modes, clause markers appear
infrequently, and this can result in large amounts of text
being sent to the speech device at once, making the system
unresponsive when asked to stop talking.  Splitting on white
space makes emacspeak's stop command responsive.  However,
when splitting on white space, the speech sounds choppy
since the synthesizer is getting a word at a time.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-stop-immediately-while-typing nil
@kbd{ control e d  cap I  }

Toggle state of variable `dtk-stop-immediately-while-typing'.
As the name implies, if T then speech flushes immediately as you
type.  Optional argument PREFIX specifies if the setting applies
to all buffers.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-strip-octals nil
@kbd{ control e d o }

Toggle stripping of octals.
Interactive prefix arg means
 toggle the global default value, and then set the current local
value to the result.

@deffn {Interactive Command} emacspeak-daisy-mode nil
A DAISY front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

Pre-requisites:

0) mpg123 for playing mp3 files
1) libxml and libxslt packages
2) xml-parse.el for parsing XML in Emacs Lisp.

The Emacspeak DAISY front-end is launched by command
emacspeak-daisy-open-book  bound to C-e C-b.

This command switches to a special buffer that has DAISY
commands bounds to single keystrokes-- see the ke-binding
list at the end of this description.  Use Emacs online help
facility to look up help on these commands.

emacspeak-daisy-mode provides the necessary functionality to
navigate and listen to Daisy talking books.

Here is a list of all emacspeak DAISY commands along with their key-bindings:

key             binding
---             -------

RET             emacspeak-daisy-play-content-under-point
SPC             emacspeak-daisy-play-audio-under-point
?               describe-mode

@node emacspeak-gridtext
@section emacspeak-gridtext




Commentary:
Emacspeak's table browsing mode allows one to
efficiently access  content that is tabular in nature.
That module also provides functions for infering table
structure where possible.
Often, such structure is hard to infer automatically
--but might be known to the user 
e.g. treat columns 1 through 30 as one column of a table
and so on.
This module allows the user to specify a conceptual grid
that is "overlaid" on the region of text to turn it into
a table for tabular browsing. For now, elements of the
grid are "one line" high --but that may change in the
future if necessary. This module is useful for browsing
structured text files and the output from programs that
tabulate their output.
It's also useful for handling multicolumn text.

Commentary:
Flexible hide and show for emacspeak.
This module allows one to easily hide or expose
blocks of lines starting with a common prefix.
It is motivated by the need to flexibly hide quoted text in email

starting on the current line.  A block of text is defined as
a portion of the buffer in which all lines start with a
common PREFIX.  Optional interactive prefix arg causes all
blocks in current buffer to be hidden or exposed.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} emacspeak-hide-speak-block-sans-prefix nil
@kbd{ control e control j }

Speaks current block after stripping its prefix.
If the current block is not hidden, it first hides it.
This is useful because as you locate blocks, you can invoke this
command to listen to the block,
and when you have heard enough navigate easily  to move past the block.

images and produce text.
Prerequisites:
Sane installed and working.
scanimage to generate tiff files from scanner.
tiffcp to compress the tiff file.

by default this module assumes that the OCR executable
is named "ocr"



Automatically generated documentation
for commands defined in module  emacspeak-ocr.



@deffn {Interactive Command} emacspeak-ocr nil
@kbd{ control e control o }

An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.  

Page image is acquired using tools from the SANE package.
The acquired image is run through the OCR engine if one is
available, and the results placed in a buffer that is
suitable for browsing the results.

For detailed help, invoke command emacspeak-ocr bound to
C-e C-o to launch emacspeak-ocr-mode, and press
`?' to display mode-specific help for emacspeak-ocr-mode.

@deffn {Interactive Command} emacspeak-ocr-backward-page nil

Run OCR engine on current image after flip-flopping it.
Useful if you've scanned a page upside down and are using an engine that does not automatically flip the image for you.
You need the imagemagik family of tools --- we use mogrify to transform the image.
Prompts for image file if file corresponding to the expected
`current page' is not found.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} emacspeak-ocr-forward-page nil
Like forward page, but tracks page number of current document.
@end deffn



@deffn {Interactive Command} emacspeak-ocr-mode nil
 An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

Pre-requisites:

1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

2) An OCR engine.

1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have
the utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a
tiff file.  Then set variable
emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at this utility.
By default, this is set to `scanimage' which is the image
scanning utility provided by SANE.

By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired
tiff image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.
Variable emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to `tiffcp' by
default; if you use something else, you should customize
this variable.

2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and
working.  By default this front-end assumes that OCR is
available as /usr/bin/ocr.

Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying
OCR to it work independently of Emacs, you can use this
Emacspeak front-end to enable easy OCR access from within
Emacspeak.

The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command
emacspeak-ocr bound to C-e C-o.  

This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR
commands bounds to single keystrokes-- see the ke-binding
list at the end of this description.  Use Emacs online help
facility to look up help on these commands.

emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to
scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned
images and the resulting text are saved under directory
~/ocr; see variable emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.
Invoking command emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound
to M-x emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory will open this directory.

By default, the document being scanned is named `untitled'.
You can name the document by using command
emacspeak-ocr-name-document bound to
M-x emacspeak-ocr-name-document.  The document name is used
in constructing the name of the image and text files.

@node emacspeak-pronounce
@section emacspeak-pronounce




Commentary:
This module implements user customizable pronunciation dictionaries
for emacspeak. Custom pronunciations can be defined per file, per
directory and/or per major mode. Emacspeak maintains a persistent
user dictionary upon request and loads these in new emacspeak
sessions. This module implements the user interface to the custom
dictionary as well as providing the internal API used by the rest
of emacspeak in using the dictionary.
Algorithm:

The persistent dictionary is a hash table where the hash keys are
filenames, directory names, or major-mode names. The hash values
are association lists defining the dictionary. Users of this module
can retrieve a dictionary made up of all applicable association
lists for a given file.

@node emacspeak-sounds
@section emacspeak-sounds




Commentary:
This module provides the interface for generating auditory icons in emacspeak.
Design goal:
1) Auditory icons should be used to provide additional feedback,
not as a gimmick.
2) The interface should be usable at all times without the icons:
e.g. when on a machine without a sound card.
3) General principle for when to use an icon:
Convey information about events taking place in parallel.
For instance, if making a selection automatically moves the current focus
to the next choice,
We speak the next choice, while indicating the fact that something was selected with a sound cue.
 This interface will assume the availability of a shell command "play"
that can take one or more sound files and play them.
This module will also provide a mapping between names in the elisp world and actual sound files.
Modules that wish to use auditory icons should use these names, instead of actual file names.
As of Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a themes
architecture for  auditory icons.
Sound files corresponding to a given theme are found in
appropriate subdirectories of emacspeak-sounds-directory

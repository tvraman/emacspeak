Automatically generated documentation
for commands defined in module  cd-tool.

@deffn {Interactive Command} cd-tool ()
@kbd{ control e DEL }

Front-end to CDTool.
Bind this function to a convenient key-
Emacspeak users automatically have
this bound to <DEL> in the emacspeak keymap.

@node dtk-speak
@section dtk-speak

Commentary:
Defines the TTS interface.

Automatically generated documentation
for commands defined in module  dtk-speak.

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-add-cleanup-pattern (&optional DELETE)
@kbd{ control e d a }

Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that
are cleaned up.  Optional interactive prefix arg deletes
this pattern if previously added.  Cleaning up repeated
patterns results in emacspeak speaking the pattern followed
by a repeat count instead of speaking all the characters
making up the pattern.  Thus, by adding the repeating
pattern `.' (this is already added by default) emacspeak
will say ``aw fifteen dot'' when speaking the string
``...............'' instead of ``period period period period
''
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-notes-shutdown ()
Shutdown midi system.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-pause (&optional PREFIX)
@kbd{ control e p }

Pause ongoing speech.
The speech can be resumed with command `dtk-resume'
normally bound to C-e SPC.  Pausing speech is useful when one needs to
perform a few actions before continuing to read a large document.  Emacspeak
gives you speech feedback as usual once speech has been paused.  `dtk-resume'
continues the interrupted speech irrespective of the buffer
in which it is executed.
Optional PREFIX arg flushes any previously paused speech.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-reset-state ()
@kbd{ control e d  cap R  }

Restore sanity to the Dectalk.
Typically used after the Dectalk has been power   cycled.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-resume ()
@kbd{ control e SPACE }

Resume paused speech.
This command resumes  speech that has been suspended by executing
command `dtk-pause' bound to C-e p.
If speech has not been paused,
and option `dtk-resume-should-toggle' is set,
 then this command will pause ongoing speech.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-select-server (PROGRAM)
@kbd{ control e d d }

Select a speech server interactively.
Argument PROGRAM specifies the speech server program.
When called  interactively, The selected server is started immediately. 
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-character-scale (FACTOR &optional PREFIX)
@kbd{ control e d f }

Set scale FACTOR for   speech rate.
Speech rate is scaled by this factor
when speaking characters.
Interactive PREFIX arg means set   the global default value, and then set the
current local  value to the result.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-chunk-separator-syntax (S)
@kbd{ control e d RETURN }

Interactively set how text is split in chunks.
See the Emacs documentation on syntax tables for details on how characters are
classified into various syntactic classes.
Argument S specifies the syntax class.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-language (LANG)
Set language according to the argument lang.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-next-language ()

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-predefined-speech-rate (&optional PREFIX)
@kbd{ control e d 9   control e d 8   control e d 7   control e d 6   control e d 5   control e d 4   control e d 3   control e d 2   control e d 1   control e d 0 }

Set speech rate to one of nine predefined levels.
Interactive PREFIX arg says to set the rate globally.
Formula used is:
rate = dtk-speech-rate-base + dtk-speech-rate-step * level.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-preferred-language (ALIAS LANG)
Set the alias of the preferred language: 
For example if alias="en" lang="en_GB", 
then the following call:
 dtk-set-language("en") 
will set "en_GB".

@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-set-previous-language ()
Switch to the previous available language

short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
value, and then set the current local value to the result.
Note that allcaps-beep is a very useful thing when programming.
However it is irritating to have it on when reading documents.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-capitalization (&optional PREFIX)
@kbd{ control e d c }

Toggle capitalization.
when set, capitalization is indicated by a
short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
value, and then set the current local value to the result.

When debugging is on, you can switch to the buffer
*speaker* to examine the output from the process
that talks to the speech device by using command C-e d C-M-b.
Note: *speaker* is a hidden buffer, ie it has a leading space in its name.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-punctuation-mode (&optional PREFIX)
Toggle punctuation mode between "some" and "all".
Interactive PREFIX arg makes the new setting global.
@end deffn

@kbd{ control e d s }

Toggle split caps mode.
Split caps mode is useful when reading
Hungarian notation in program source code.  Interactive PREFIX arg
means toggle the global default value, and then set the current local
value to the result.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space ()
@kbd{ control e d SPACE }

Toggle splitting of speech on white space.
This affects the internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split
text purely by clause boundaries, or also include
whitespace.  By default, emacspeak sends a clause at a time
to the speech device.  This produces fluent speech for
normal use.  However in modes such as `shell-mode' and some
programming language modes, clause markers appear
infrequently, and this can result in large amounts of text
being sent to the speech device at once, making the system
unresponsive when asked to stop talking.  Splitting on white
space makes emacspeak's stop command responsive.  However,
when splitting on white space, the speech sounds choppy
since the synthesizer is getting a word at a time.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-stop-immediately-while-typing (&optional PREFIX)
@kbd{ control e d  cap I  }

Toggle state of variable `dtk-stop-immediately-while-typing'.
As the name implies, if T then speech flushes immediately as you
type.  Optional argument PREFIX specifies if the setting applies
to all buffers.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} dtk-toggle-strip-octals (&optional PREFIX)
@kbd{ control e d o }

Toggle stripping of octals.
Interactive prefix arg means
 toggle the global default value, and then set the current local
value to the result.

@node emacspeak-gridtext
@section emacspeak-gridtext

Commentary:
Emacspeak's table browsing mode allows one to
efficiently access  content that is tabular in nature.
That module also provides functions for infering table
structure where possible.
Often, such structure is hard to infer automatically
--but might be known to the user 
e.g. treat columns 1 through 30 as one column of a table
and so on.
This module allows the user to specify a conceptual grid
that is "overlaid" on the region of text to turn it into
a table for tabular browsing. For now, elements of the
grid are "one line" high --but that may change in the
future if necessary. This module is useful for browsing
structured text files and the output from programs that
tabulate their output.
It's also useful for handling multicolumn text.

Commentary:
This module defines Emacspeak front-end to OCR.
This module assumes that sane is installed and working
for image acquisition,
and that there is an OCR engine that can take acquired
images and produce text.
Prerequisites:
Sane installed and working.
scanimage to generate tiff files from scanner.
tiffcp to compress the tiff file.
working ocr executable 
by default this module assumes that the OCR executable
is named "ocr"

Automatically generated documentation
for commands defined in module  emacspeak-ocr.

@deffn {Interactive Command} emacspeak-ocr ()
@kbd{ control e control o }

An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.  

Page image is acquired using tools from the SANE package.
The acquired image is run through the OCR engine if one is
available, and the results placed in a buffer that is
suitable for browsing the results.

For detailed help, invoke command emacspeak-ocr bound to
C-e C-o to launch emacspeak-ocr-mode, and press
`?' to display mode-specific help for emacspeak-ocr-mode.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} emacspeak-ocr-backward-page (&optional COUNT-IGNORED)

@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} emacspeak-ocr-forward-page (&optional COUNT-IGNORED)

@end deffn

@deffn {Interactive Command} emacspeak-ocr-mode ()
 An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

Pre-requisites:

1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

2) An OCR engine.

1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have
the utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a
tiff file.  Then set variable
emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at this utility.
By default, this is set to `scanimage' which is the image
scanning utility provided by SANE.

By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired
tiff image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.
Variable emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to `tiffcp' by
default; if you use something else, you should customize
this variable.

2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and
working.  By default this front-end assumes that OCR is
available as /usr/bin/ocr.

Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying
OCR to it work independently of Emacs, you can use this
Emacspeak front-end to enable easy OCR access from within
Emacspeak.

The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command
emacspeak-ocr bound to C-e C-o.  

This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR
commands bounds to single keystrokes-- see the ke-binding
list at the end of this description.  Use Emacs online help
facility to look up help on these commands.

emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to
scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned
images and the resulting text are saved under directory
~/ocr; see variable emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.
Invoking command emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound
to M-x emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory will open this directory.

By default, the document being scanned is named `untitled'.
You can name the document by using command
emacspeak-ocr-name-document bound to
M-x emacspeak-ocr-name-document.  The document name is used
in constructing the name of the image and text files.

@node emacspeak-pronounce
@section emacspeak-pronounce

Commentary:
This module implements user customizable pronunciation dictionaries
for emacspeak. Custom pronunciations can be defined per file, per
directory and/or per major mode. Emacspeak maintains a persistent
user dictionary upon request and loads these in new emacspeak
sessions. This module implements the user interface to the custom
dictionary as well as providing the internal API used by the rest
of emacspeak in using the dictionary.
Algorithm:

The persistent dictionary is a hash table where the hash keys are
filenames, directory names, or major-mode names. The hash values
are association lists defining the dictionary. Users of this module
can retrieve a dictionary made up of all applicable association
lists for a given file.

Commentary:
This module provides the interface for generating auditory icons in emacspeak.
Design goal:
1) Auditory icons should be used to provide additional feedback,
not as a gimmick.
2) The interface should be usable at all times without the icons:
e.g. when on a machine without a sound card.
3) General principle for when to use an icon:
Convey information about events taking place in parallel.
For instance, if making a selection automatically moves the current focus
to the next choice,
We speak the next choice, while indicating the fact that something was selected with a sound cue.
 This interface will assume the availability of a shell command "play"
that can take one or more sound files and play them.
This module will also provide a mapping between names in the elisp world and actual sound files.
Modules that wish to use auditory icons should use these names, instead of actual file names.
As of Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a themes
architecture for  auditory icons.
Sound files corresponding to a given theme are found in
appropriate subdirectories of emacspeak-sounds-directory

@deffn {Interactive Command} emacspeak-realaudio (&optional IGNORED)
@kbd{ control e : }

Start or control streaming audio including MP3 and
realaudio.  If using `TRPlayer' as the player, accepts
trplayer control commands if a stream is already playing.
Otherwise, the playing stream is simply stopped.  If no
stream is playing, this command prompts for a realaudio
resource.  Realaudio resources can be specified either as a
Realaudio URL, the location of a local Realaudio file, or as
the name of a local Realaudio metafile. Realaudio resources
you have played in this session are available in the
minibuffer history.  The default is to play the resource you
played most recently. Emacspeak uses the contents of the
directory specified by variable
emacspeak-realaudio-shortcuts-directory to offer a set of
completions. Hit space to use this completion list.

If using TRPlayer, you can either give one-shot commands
using command emacspeak-realaudio available from anywhere on
the audio desktop as `C-e :'.
Alternatively, switch to buffer *realaudio* using
`C-e :;' if you wish to issue many
navigation commands.  Note that buffer *realaudio* uses a
special major mode that provides the various navigation
commands via single keystrokes.

Emacs/W3 is not quite a complete XML+CSS browser, but it  does a
good enough job for many things, especially the XML files from

XML browser.
This command opens a specified XML file under the covers and has
W3 render it using CSS as available. The result on bookshare.org

@node voice-setup
@section voice-setup

Commentary:
A voice is to audio as a font is to a visual display.
A personality is to audio as a face is to a visual display.

Voice-lock-mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to be
spoken in one personality, strings in another, reserved words in another,
documentation strings in another, and so on.

Comments will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality'.
Strings will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-string-personality'.
Doc strings will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-doc-string-personality'.
Function and variable names (in their defining forms) will be
 spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-function-name-personality'.
Reserved words will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-keyword-personality'.

To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x voice-lock-mode.
When this minor mode is on, the voices of the current line are
updated with every insertion or deletion.

How faces map to voices: TTS engine specific modules e.g.,
dectalk-voices.el and outloud-voices.el define a standard set
of voice names.  This module maps standard "personality"
names to these pre-defined voices.  It does this via special
form def-voice-font which takes a personality name, a voice
name and a face name to set up the mapping between face and
personality, and personality and voice.
Newer Emacspeak modules should use voice-setup-add-map when
defining face->personality mappings.
Older code calls def-voice-font directly, but over time those
calls will be changed to the more succinct form provided by
voice-setup-add-map. For use from other moduels, also see
function voice-setup-map-face which is useful when mapping a
single face.
Both voice-setup-add-map and voice-setup-map-face call
special form def-voice-font.

Special form def-voice-font sets up the personality name to
be available via custom.  new voices can be defined using CSS
style specifications see special form defvoice Voices defined
via defvoice can be customized via custom see the
documentation for defvoice.

its face->personality map is replaced by face->inaudible.  If
personality at point is inaudible, and there is a cached value,
then the original face->personality mapping is restored.  In
either case, the buffer is refontified to have the new mapping
take effect.

All of these URL templates can be invoked via command

@itemize @bullet
@item Prompt for the relevant information.
@item Fetch the resulting URL using an appropriate fetcher.

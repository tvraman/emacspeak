  <h4 class="subsection">9.1.2 Searching, Replacing, And Spell
  Checking</h4>

  <p>Incremental search, a process by which the system prompts the
  user for a search string and moves the selection to the next
  available match while allowing the user to add more characters to
  the search string, is the search technique of choice among most
  Emacs users. As the system successively finds each match and
  provides the user the option of continuing the search.
  Incremental search is a more complex instance of traditional
  search interaction because in addition to either stopping or
  continuing the search, the user can modify the current search in
  a number of ways including specifying a longer (or shorter)
  search string.</p>

  <p>All of the user commands available during incremental search
  are documented in the online Emacs info manual. These are
  speech-enabled by Emacspeak to provide spoken prompts as the
  dialog begins; auditory icons indicate a search hit or search
  miss as the search progresses. Along with auditory icons
  <em>search-hit</em> and <em>search-miss</em> the user also hears
  the current line spoken, and in the case of a search hit, the
  matching text is <em>aurally</em> highlighted by using the
  standard audio formatting technique of changing voice
  characteristic. This feedback proves extremely effective when the
  search pattern appears several times on a single line; the user
  is unambiguously cued to the current match.</p>

  <p>Search and replace actions are an extension to the basic
  conversational gestures of a search dialog. In addition to
  specifying a search string, the user also specifies a replacement
  string. On the Emacspeak desktop, this functionality is provided
  by command <em>query-replace</em>. The speech-enabled version of
  this interaction prompts the user for the search and replacement
  texts. The auditory feedback during the interactive search and
  replacement process parallels that described in the case of
  incremental search. Audio formatting to indicate the occurrence
  that is about to be replaced proves an effective means of
  avoiding erroneous modifications to the text being edited. As an
  example, consider using command <em>query-replace</em> to locate
  and replace the second occurrence of <b>foo</b> with <b>bar</b>
  in the text</p>

  <p>&lsquo;<samp>Do not change this fool, but change this
  food.</samp>&rsquo;</p>

  <p>When the search matches the first occurrence of <b>foo</b> in
  word <em>fool</em>, the aural highlighting helps the user in
  answering &ldquo;no&rdquo; in response to question &ldquo;should
  this occurrence be replaced&rdquo;. In addition to allowing the
  user to supply a simple &ldquo;yes or no&rdquo; answer for each
  match, command <em>query-replace</em> also allows the user to
  specify a number of other valid answers as described in the
  online Emacs documentation.</p><a name="Spell-Checking" id=
  "Spell-Checking"></a>

  <h4 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Spell Checking</h4>

  <p>A more complex instance of conversational gesture
  &ldquo;search and replace&rdquo; is exhibited by standard spell
  checking dialogues. Spell checking differs from the search and
  replace dialog described above in that the search and replacement
  text is guessed by the system based on an available dictionary.
  Words that are not found in the dictionary are flagged as
  potential spelling errors, and the system offers an interactive
  search and replace dialog for each of these possible errors.
  During this dialog, the system successively selects each
  occurrence of the possibly erroneous word and offers a set of
  possible replacements. Unlike in the case of simple search and
  replace, more than one possible replacement string is offered,
  since a potential spelling error can be corrected by more than
  one word appearing in the dictionary.</p>

  <p>In the visual interface, such spell checking dialogues are
  realized by displaying the available choices in a pop-up window
  and allowing the user to pick a correction Once a correction is
  selected, the user is offered the choice of interactively
  replacing the erroneous word with the correction.</p>

  <p>The spell checking interface on the Emacspeak desktop is
  speech-enabled to provide fluent auditory feedback. The visual
  interface parallels that described above and is provided by
  package <code>ispell</code> which is part of the standard Emacs
  distribution. Emacspeak provides a spoken prompt that is composed
  of the line containing the possibly erroneous word (which is
  aurally highlighted to set it apart from the rest of the text on
  that line) and the available corrections. Each correction is
  prefixed with a number that the user can use to select it. Once a
  correction is selected, the interaction continues with the query
  and replace interaction described earlier. The speech interface
  to the spell checker is as fluent as the visual interface. Notice
  that Emacspeak users do not need to concern themselves with the
  details of the visual display such as &ldquo;the corrections are
  displayed in a window at the top of the screen&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>In addition to the standard spell checker described above,
  newer versions of Emacs include an &ldquo;on-the-fly&rdquo; spell
  checker that flags erroneous words as they are typed. Emacspeak
  speech-enables package <code>flyspell</code> so that such
  erroneous words are aurally highlighted.</p>

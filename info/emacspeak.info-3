     Goes to the top of the current column.

12.191.1.12 emacspeak-table-mode
................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-table-mode

     Major mode for browsing tables.
     Table mode is designed to allow speech users to browse tabular data
     with full contextual feedback while retaining all the power of the
     two-dimensional spatial layout of tables.

     In table mode, the arrow keys move between cells of the table.
     Emacspeak speaks the cell contents in a user-customizable way.  The
     visual display is kept in sync with the speech you hear; however
     Emacspeak is examining the entire table in order to speak the current
     cell content intelligently.

     You can interactively specify that emacspeak should speak either the row or
     column header (or both) while speaking each cell.  You can also specify a row
     or column filter that should be applied when speaking entire rows or columns
     –this lets you view slices of a table.  You can move to a specific row or
     column by searching the cell contents or by searching the row or column
     headers to locate items of interest.

     Here is a short description of the special commands provided in this mode.

     The next four commands help you move to the edges of the table:

     E               emacspeak-table-goto-right
     A               emacspeak-table-goto-left
     B               emacspeak-table-goto-bottom
     T               emacspeak-table-goto-top

     The next two commands let you search the table.
     The commands ask you if you want to search rows or columns.
     When searching headers remember that row 0 is the column header, and that column 0 is the row header.

     h               emacspeak-table-search-headers
     s               emacspeak-table-search

     The next command lets you specify how cell contents should be spoken.  Specify
     one of: ‘b’ for both, ‘c’ for column, ‘r’ for row, ‘f’ for row filtering and
     ‘g’ for column filtering. –table cells with then be spoken with both (or
     either)row and column headers, or with the filter applied.

     a               emacspeak-table-select-automatic-speaking-method

     The next set of commands speak the current table cell:

     .               emacspeak-table-speak-coordinates
     b               emacspeak-table-speak-both-headers-and-element
     SPC             emacspeak-table-speak-current-element
     c               emacspeak-table-speak-column-header-and-element
     r               e macspeak-table-speak-row-header-and-element

     The next set of commands navigate the table:

     right               emacspeak-table-next-column
     left               emacspeak-table-previous-column
     down               emacspeak-table-next-row
     up               emacspeak-table-previous-row
     j               emacspeak-table-goto
     S-tab               emacspeak-table-previous-column
     TAB               emacspeak-table-next-column

     Row and Column Filtering

     Filtering is designed to let you view slices of a table.
     They are specified as lists of numbers and strings.
     The concept is best explained with an example.

     A row filter specifies which of the entries in the current row should be
     spoken.Entries are numbered starting with 0.  Thus, when working with a table
     having 8 columns, a row filter of (1 2 3) will speak only entries 1 2 and 3.
     Use the sample tables in etc/tables   to familiarize yourself with this
     feature. Note that you can intersperse meaningful strings in the list that
     specifies the filter.

12.202 emacspeak-transient
==========================

TRANSIENT == Transient commands — used by magit and friends.  This
module speech-enables transient.

12.202.1 Introduction
---------------------

Package Transient is similar to package Hydra in the sense that it can
be used to create a sequence of chained/hierarchical commands that are
invoked via a sequence of keys.  It is used by Magit for dispatching to
the various Git commands.  Speech-enabling package Transient results in
the various interactive commands producing auditory feedback.  Transient
shows an ephemeral window with the currently available commands,
Emacspeak speech-enables transient–show to speak that content.

   Finally, this module defines a new minor mode called
transient-emacspeak that enables interactive browsing of the contents
displayed temporarily.  Note that without this functionality, learning
complex packages like Magit would be difficult because the list of
available commands (potentially very long) gets spoken in its entirety
by the advice on transient–show.

12.202.2 Browsing Contents Of transient–show
--------------------------------------------

When executing a command defined via Transient — e.g.  command
Magit-dispatch and friends, press ‘C-z’ (transient-suspend) to
temporarily suspend the currently active transient.  Emacspeak now
displays a *transient-emacspeak* buffer that displays the contents of
the most recently displayed transient choices.  Pressing ‘C-c’ resumes
the transient; Pressing ‘C-q’ quits the transient.

12.202.3 Emacspeak-Transient Commands
-------------------------------------

12.202.3.1 emacspeak-transient-mode
...................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-transient-mode

     emacspeak integration with Transient.

     In addition to any hooks its parent mode ‘special-mode’ might have run,
     this mode runs the hook ‘emacspeak-transient-mode-hook’, as the final or penultimate step
     during initialization.

     ‘C-x @ h s’

     Run Emacs built-in ‘shell’ command when not in a shell buffer, or
     when called with a prefix argument. When called from a shell buffer,
     switches to ‘next’ shell buffer. When called from outside a shell
     buffer, find the most ‘appropriate shell’ and switch to it. Once
     switched, set default directory in that target shell to the directory
     of the source buffer.

     (fn &optional PREFIX)

12.218.1.105 emacspeak-wizards-shell-by-key

     ‘<fn> x 2’
     ‘<fn> x 1’
     ‘<fn> x 0’

     Switch to shell buffer by key. This provides a predictable
       means for switching to a specific shell buffer. When invoked
       from a non-shell-mode buffer that is a dired-buffer or is
       visiting a file, invokes ‘cd ’ in the shell to change to the
       value of ‘default-directory’ — if called with a
       prefix-arg. When already in a shell buffer, interactive prefix
       arg ‘prefix’ causes this shell to be re-keyed if appropriate
       — see M-x emacspeak-wizards-shell-re-key for an explanation
       of how re-keying works.

12.227 extra-muggles
====================

MUGGLES == Emacspeak spells for power-users.  These are extra hydras
that I dont use very often, And are being moved here from
emacspeak-muggles to save time at startup.

   This module implements no new functionality — contrast with
emacspeak-wizards.  Instead, it uses package hydra to provide
convenience key-bindings that access existing Emacspeak functionality.
You need to install package Hydra first: ‘M-x package-install hydra’.

   Note that on newer versions of Emacs, loading this module will
attempt to automatically install package hydra if it is not found.

12.227.1 Using Hydras
---------------------

See the high-level documentation for the Hydra package by executing ‘C-h
C-j ’ hydra ‘RET’.  The documentation in this section uses the same
terminology as shown in the hydra package documentation.

12.227.2 Extra Muggles
----------------------

   • View-Mode: ‘C-. v’ Temporarily behave like view-mode.
   • SmartParens: ‘C-c ,’ Smart Parens
   • m-player: ‘s-m’ Emacspeak-M-Player Commands
   • m-player: ‘s-;’ Emacspeak-M-Player muggle
   • pianobar: ‘s-'’ Emacspeak-M-pianobar Commands
   • origami: C-, / Origami bindings.
   • outliner: <C-c .> Bindings from outline-minor-mode.
   • Info-Summary: <?> in Info Info Summary Muggle

   Emacspeak automatically speaks Hydra hints when displayed.  To
silence all Hydra hints, set hydra-is-helpful to nil.  To temporarily
silence speaking of Hydra hints, Muggles can bind command
‘emacspeak-hydra-toggle-talkative’.  As an example, Muggle ‘ViewMode’
binds ‘s’ to this command.

12.227.3 Extra-Muggles Commands

12.227.3.1 emacspeak-muggles-emacspeak-m-player-mode-map-cmd

12.235 soundscape
=================

Soundscapes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape> define an
acoustic environment.  Boodler at <http://boodler.org> is a Python-based
SoundScape generator.  To use this module, first install boodler.  Then
install the soundscape packages (*.boop) files available at
<http://boodler.org/lib>.  Make sure boodler works and produces audio in
your environment.  finally install the Boodler packages from
emacspeak/scapes from the Emacspeak GitHub repository by running ‘cd
emacspeak/scapes; make ’

   When boodler is set up and all packages installed, copy file
emacspeak/scapes/soundscapes to ~/.boodler/Collection.  The above file
lists all installed SoundScapes.  Directory emacspeak/scapes also
contains additional Boodler Agents and SoundScapes that I have created
for use with Emacspeak.

   Module soundscape.el defines Emacs conveniences for running
Soundscapes.  Main Entry Points:

   • M-x soundscape-toggle – Enables or disables automatic SoundScapes.
   • M-x soundscape – runs a named SoundScape
   • M-x soundscape-stop – Stops a specified running Soundscape.
   • M-x soundscape-kill – Kills all running Soundscapes.

   When automatic Soundscapes are enabled, SoundScapes are started and
stopped based on the current major mode.  Active Soundscape are
displayed as part of the minor-mode-alist.  Command
emacspeak-speak-minor-mode-line can be used to have this spoken.

   Thus, SoundScapes can be thought of as reflecting the _mood_ of the
current _mode_.  This package defines a single SOUNDSCAPE-DEFAULT-THEME
that is loaded using ‘(soundscape-load soundscape-default-theme)’.
Emacs modes that provide similar functionality e.g., communication ==
email, IM, ...  map to the same _mood_.

12.236 sox
==========

This module defines a convenient speech-enabled interface for editing
mp3 and wav files using SoX.

   Launching M-x sox creates a special interaction buffer that provides
single keystroke commands for editing and applying effects to a selected
sound file.  For adding mp3 support to sox, do

   sudo apt-get libsox-fmt-mp3 install

   This module provides support for ladspa effects using module
ladspa.el.  To use ladspa effects with SoX, you need a relatively new
build of Sox; The stock SoX that is package for Debian/Ubuntu does not
always work.  This module can be used independent of Emacspeak.

12.237 sox-gen
==============

Provides binaural audio along with pre-defined themes.  This module can
be used independent of Emacspeak.

12.237.1 Binaural Beats Using SoX
---------------------------------

A binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when two different
pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1500 Hz, with
less than a 40 Hz difference between them, are presented to a listener
dichotically (one through each ear).  For example, if a 530 Hz pure tone
is presented to a subject’s right ear, while a 520 Hz pure tone is
presented to the subject’s left ear, the listener will perceive the
auditory illusion of a third tone, in addition to the two pure-tones
presented to each ear.  The third sound is called a binaural beat, and
in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency
of 10 Hz, that being the difference between the 530 Hz and 520 Hz pure
tones presented to each ear.  For more details, see
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats>.

   This module implements a set of user-facing commands for generating
binaural beats.  The commands are organized from high-level commands
that play predefined binaural beats to lower-level commands that can be
used to create new effect sequences.

   All binaural beat sequences are played with a relatively low gain —
they are designed to be heard in the background and when effective blend
fully into the background.  You can increase the overall volume of all
binaural beat sequences by customizing
 -- Variable: User Option sox-binaural-gain-offset to a positive value
   — default is 0.

12.237.1.1 High-Level Commands For Pre-Defined Binaural Beats
.............................................................

These commands can be called directly to play one of the predefined
binaural beats.

   • ‘sox-rev-up’: A set of binaural beats designed for use at the start
     of the day.  Transitions from _Dream_ -> _Think_ ->_Act_ ->
     _Focus_.
   • ‘sox-wind-down’: A set of binaural beats for winding down at the
     end of the day.  This can be thought of as the reverse of
     ‘sox-rev-up’ and the sequence transitions from _Act_ -> _Think_ ->
     _Dream_ ->_Sleep_.
   • ‘sox-turn-down’: Designed for falling asleep.  This sequence starts
     with a short period of _Dream_ before moving to _Sleep_.
   • ‘sox-relax’: A variant of the previous sequence, ‘sox-relax’ spends
     equal time in _Dream_ and _Sleep_.
   • ‘sox-binaural’: Provide a completion-based front-end to playing any
     one of the predefined binaural effects (_Delta_, _Theta_, _Alpha_,
     _Beta_, or _Gamma_.  The previously defined sequences are built up
     using these effects.
   • ‘sox-beats-binaural’: Plays a collection of binaural beats,
     prompting for carrier and beat frequencies for each tone.  The
     predefined sequences listed earlier were created after first
     generating experimental beat-sequences using this command.
   • ‘sox-slide-binaural’: Prompts for two binaural effects (see above)
     and generates a binaural beat that _slides_ from the first effect
     to the second over a specified duration.
   • ‘sox-chakras’: Pick amongst one of a predefined set of sequences
     designed for _Chakra_ meditation.
   • ‘sox-tone-binaural’: Generate a simple binaural beat with a single
     carrier frequency.
   • ‘sox-tone-slide-binaural’: Generate a tone that slides from one
     binaural beat to another.

   M-: (get-toy-braille-string "just a test")

   That’s just a toy, meant as an excuse and maybe a tool to learn a bit
of braille, nothing more.

   Unicode fonts are needed.

   You can try:

   M-: (set-default-font "-*-unifont-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*")

   or

   M-: (set-default-font "-*-clearlyu-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-*")

   (it will only work if the relative font is installed and properly

12.240 voice-setup
==================

A voice is to audio as a font is to a visual display.  A personality is
to audio as a face is to a visual display.

   Voice-lock-mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to be
spoken in one personality, strings in another, reserved words in
another, documentation strings in another, and so on.

   Comments will be spoken in ‘voice-comment-personality’.  Strings will
be spoken in ‘voice-string-personality’.  Function and variable names
(in their defining forms) will be spoken in
‘voice-function-name-personality’.  Reserved words will be spoken in
‘voice-keyword-personality’.

   To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x voice-lock-mode.
When this minor mode is on, the voices of the current line are updated
with every insertion or deletion.

   How faces map to voices: TTS engine specific modules e.g.,
dectalk-voices.el and outloud-voices.el define a standard set of voice
names.  This module maps standard "personality" names to these
pre-defined voices.  It does this via special form def-voice-font which
takes a personality name, a voice name and a face name to set up the
mapping between face and personality, and personality and voice.  Newer
Emacspeak modules should use voice-setup-add-map when defining
face->personality mappings.  Older code calls def-voice-font directly,
but over time those calls will be changed to the more succinct form
provided by voice-setup-add-map.  For use from other modules, also see
function voice-setup-map-face which is useful when mapping a single
face.  Both voice-setup-add-map and voice-setup-map-face call special
form def-voice-font.

   Special form def-voice-font sets up the personality name to be
available via custom.  new voices can be defined using CSS style
specifications see special form defvoice Voices defined via defvoice can
be customized via custom see the documentation for defvoice.

12.240.1 Voice-Setup Commands
-----------------------------

12.240.1.1 voice-lock-mode
..........................

 -- Command: voice-lock-mode (&optional arg)
     ‘C-e d v’
     ‘<fn> d v’

     Toggle voice lock mode.

     If called interactively, enable Voice-Lock mode if ARG is
     positive, and disable it if ARG is zero or negative.  If called
     from Lisp, also enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil, and
     toggle it if ARG is ‘toggle’; disable the mode otherwise.

     The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
     it is disabled.

     (fn &optional ARG)

12.240.1.2 voice-lock-mode–turn-on
..................................

 -- Command: voice-lock-mode--turn-on

     Turn on Voice Lock mode .

12.240.1.3 voice-setup-describe-personality
...........................................

 -- Command: voice-setup-describe-personality (personality)
     ‘C-h C-v’
     ‘<f1> C-v’
     ‘<help> C-v’

     Describe specified voice — analogous to C-h /.
     When called interactively, ‘personality’ defaults to first personality at point.
     If there are multiple personalities at point,
     these are available via minibuffer history.

     (fn PERSONALITY)

12.240.1.4 voice-setup-toggle-silence-personality
.................................................

 -- Command: voice-setup-toggle-silence-personality
     ‘C-e M-q’
     ‘<fn> M-q’

     Toggle audibility of personality under point  .
     If personality at point is currently audible, its
     face->personality map is cached in a buffer local variable, and
     its face->personality map is replaced by face->inaudible.  If
     personality at point is inaudible, and there is a cached value,
     then the original face->personality mapping is restored.  In
     either case, the buffer is refontified to have the new mapping
     take effect.

13 Emacspeak Keyboard Commands.
*******************************

This chapter gives an overview of all the keymaps used by Emacspeak.
For a complete reference, see *Note emacspeak::.  For basic usage, see
*Note Basic Usage::.

   Emacspeak uses the following keymaps, each of which are invoked by a
specific prefix key.
‘C-e’
     The main Emacspeak keymap.
‘C-e d’
     The text-to-speech keymap.
‘C-;’
     The Emacspeak hyper keymap.
‘C-'’
     The emacspeak super keymap.
‘C-,’
     The Emacspeak alt keymap.
‘C-.’
     The Emacspeak super keymap.
‘C-e x’
     The emacspeak ‘x’ keymap.
‘C-e C-x’
     The Emacspeak ‘C-x’ keymap.

   Primary Emacspeak commands start with ‘C-e’.  Following ‘C-e’ with
‘d’ invokes commands that control the text-to-speech engine.  Note that
silencing speech is an exception to this rule — Speech silence commands
are placed directly on the primary emacspeak-keymap (‘C-e s’ and ‘C-e
.’).

   In addition, Emacspeak introduces five additional keymaps for binding
its extensive set of facilities to convenient keystrokes.

   When running under a windowing system, Emacs automatically receives
keys ‘C-;’, ‘C-'’, ‘C-,’ and ‘C-.’.  When running on the Linux console,
these keys become available after loading the custom Linux keymap found
in ‘emacspeak/tvr/console-keymaps’ after checking out the emacspeak
repository from <https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak>.

   Emacspeak defines personal keymaps accessible via ‘C-e x’ and ‘C-e
C-x’.  For now, emacspeak does not bind any commands in keymap ‘C-e C-x’
— this keymap is left for end-user personalization.

   Note that the information presented in the following subsections can
also be viewed via Emacs’ built-in Help system; e.g., Press ‘C-; C-h’ to
get a ‘*Help*’ buffer that displays all keys bound in
‘emacspeak-hyper-keymap’.

14 TTS Servers
**************

Emacspeak produces spoken output by communicating with one of many
speech servers.  This section documents the communication protocol
between the client application i.e.  Emacspeak, and the TTS (Text to
Speech) server.  This section is primarily intended for developers
wishing to:

   • Create new speech servers that comply with this communication
     protocol

   • Developers of other client applications who wish to use the various
     Emacspeak speech servers.

   For additional notes on how to log and view TTS server commands when
developing a speech server, see
<http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2015/04/howto-log-speech-server-output-to-aid.html>.

14.1 High-level Overview
========================

The TTS server reads commands from standard input, and script
_speech-server_ can be used to cause a TTS server to communicate via a
TCP socket.  Speech server commands are used by the client application
to make specific requests of the server; the server listens for these
requests in a non-blocking read loop and executes requests as they
become available.  Requests can be classified as follows:

   • Commands that send text to be spoken.

   • Commands that set _state_ of the TTS server.

   All commands are of the form

     commandWord {arguments}

   The braces are optional if the command argument contains no white
space.  The speech server maintains a _current state_ that determines
various characteristics of spoken output such as speech rate,
punctuations mode etc.  (see set of commands that manipulate speech
state for complete list).  The client application _queues_ The text and
non-speech audio output to be produced before asking the server to
_dispatch_ the set of queued requests, i.e.  start producing output.

   Once the server has been asked to produce output, it removes items
from the front of the queue, sends the requisite commands to the
underlying TTS engine, and waits for the engine to acknowledge that the
request has been completely processed.  This is a non-blocking
operation, i.e., if the client application generates additional
requests, these are processed _immediately_.

   The above design allows the Emacspeak TTS server to be _highly_
responsive; Client applications can queue large amounts of text
(typically queued a clause at a time to achieve the best prosody), ask
the TTS server to start speaking, and interrupt the spoken output at any
time.

14.1.1 Commands That Queue Output.
----------------------------------

This section documents commands that either produce spoken output, or
queue output to be produced on demand.  Commands that place the request
on the queue are clearly marked.

     version

   Speaks the _version_ of the TTS engine.  Produces output immediately.

     tts_say text

   Speaks the specified _text_ immediately.  The text is not
pre-processed in any way, contrast this with the primary way of speaking
text which is to queue text before asking the server to process the
queue.

   Note that this command needs to handle the special syntax for
morpheme boundaries ‘[*]’.  The ‘[*]’ syntax is specific to the Dectalk
family of synthesizers; servers for other TTS engines need to map this
pattern to the engine-specific code for each engine.  As an example, see
‘servers/outloud’ A morpheme boundary results in synthesizing compound
words such as _left bracket_ with the right intonation; using a space
would result in that phrase being synthesized as two separate words.

     l c

   Speak _c_ a single character, as a letter.  The character is spoken
immediately.  This command uses the TTS engine’s capability to speak a
single character with the ability to flush speech _immediately_.  Client
applications wishing to produce character-at-a-time output, e.g., when
providing character echo during keyboard input should use this command.

     d

   This command is used to _dispatch_ all queued requests.  It was
renamed to a single character command (like many of the commonly used
TTS server commands) to work more effectively over slow (9600) dialup
lines.  The effect of calling this command is for the TTS server to
start processing items that have been queued via earlier requests.

     tts_pause

   This pauses speech _immediately_.  It does not affect queued
requests; when command _tts_resume_ is called, the output resumes at the
point where it was paused.  Not all TTS engines provide this capability.

     tts_resume

   Resume spoken output if it has been paused earlier.

     s

   Stop speech _immediately_.  Spoken output is interrupted, and all
pending requests are flushed from the queue.

     q text

   Queues text to be spoken.  No spoken output is produced until a
_dispatch_ request is received via execution of command _d_.

     c codes

   Queues synthesis codes to be sent to the TTS engine.  Codes are sent
to the engine with no further transformation or processing.  The codes
are inserted into the output queue and will be dispatched to the TTS
engine at the appropriate point in the output stream.

     a filename

   Cues the audio file identified by filename for playing.

     t freq length

   Queues a tone to be played at the specified frequency and having the
specified length.  Frequency is specified in hertz and length is
specified in milliseconds.

     sh duration

   Queues the specified duration of silence.  Silence is specified in
milliseconds.

14.1.2 Commands That Set State
------------------------------

     tts_reset

   Reset TTS engine to default settings.

     tts_set_punctuations mode

   Sets TTS engine to the specified punctuation mode.  Typically, TTS
servers provide at least three modes:

   • None: Do not speak punctuation characters.

   • Some: Speak some punctuation characters.  Used for English prose.

   • All: Speak out _all_ punctuation characters; useful in programming
     modes.

     tts_set_speech_rate rate

   Sets speech rate.  The interpretation of this value is typically
engine specific.

     tts_set_character_scale factor

   Scale factor applied to speech rate when speaking individual
characters.Thus, setting speech rate to 500 and character scale to 1.2
will cause command _l_ to use a speech rate of _500 * 1.2 = 600_.

     tts_split_caps flag

   Set state of _split caps_ processing.  Turn this on to speak
mixed-case (AKA Camel Case) identifiers.

     tts_capitalize flag

   Indicate capitalization via a beep tone or voice pitch.

     tts_allcaps_beep flag

   Setting this flag produces a high-pitched beep when speaking words
that are in all-caps, e.g.  abbreviations.

15.1 Turning Twenty
===================

One afternoon in the third week of September 1994, I started writing
myself a small Emacs extension using Lisp Advice to make Emacs speak to
me so I could use a Linux laptop.  As Emacspeak turns twenty, this
article is both a quick look back over the twenty years of lessons
learned, as well as a glimpse into what might be possible as we evolve
to a world of connected, ubiquitous computing.  This article draws on
Learning To Program In 10 Years (http://norvig.com/21-days.html) by
Peter Norvig for some of its inspiration.

15.2 Using UNIX With Speech Output — 1994
=========================================

As a graduate student at Cornell
(http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/raman/raman.html), I accessed my
Unix workstation (SunOS) from an Intel 486 PC running IBM Screen-Reader.
There was no means of directly using a UNIX box at the time; after
graduating, I continued doing the same for about six months at Digital
Research in Cambridge — the only difference being that my desktop
workstation was now a DEC-Alpha.  Throughout this time, Emacs was my
environment of choice for everything from software development and
Internet access to writing documents.

   In fall of 1994, I wanted to start using a laptop running Linux; a
colleague (Dave Wecker) was retiring his 386mhz laptop that already had
Linux on it and I decided to inherit it.  But there was only one problem
— until then I had always accessed a UNIX machine from a secondary PC
running a screen-reader — something that would clearly make no sense
with a laptop!

   Another colleague, Win Treese, had pointed out the interesting
possibilities presented by package *advice* in Emacs 19.23 — a few weeks
earlier, he had sent around a small snippet of code that magically
modified Emacs’ version-control primitive to first create an _RCS_
directory if none existed before adding a file to version control.  When
I speculated about using the Linux laptop, Dave remarked — you live in
Emacs anyway — why dont you just make it talk!

   Connecting the dots, I decided to write myself a tool that augmented
Emacs’ default behavior to _speak_ — within about 4 hours, version 0.01
of Emacspeak was up and running.

15.3 Key Enabler — Emacs And Lisp Advice
========================================

It took me a couple of weeks to fully recognize the potential of what I
had built with Emacs Lisp Advice.  Until then, I had used screen-readers
to listen to the contents of the visual display — but Lisp Advice let me
do a lot more — it enabled Emacspeak to generate highly context-specific
spoken feedback, augmented by a set of auditory icons.  I later
formalized this design under the name speech-enabled applications
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-voicing).  For a detailed overview of
the architecture of Emacspeak, see the chapter on Emacspeak
(http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/bc-emacspeak/publish-emacspeak-bc.html)
in the book Beautiful Code
(http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2007/07/emacspeak-and-beautiful-code.html)
from O’Reilly.

15.4 Key Component — Text To Speech (TTS)
=========================================

Emacspeak is a speech-subsystem for Emacs; it depends on an external
Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to produce speech.  In 1994, Digital
Equipment released what would turn out to be the last in the line of
hardware DECTalk synthesizers, the DECTalk Express.  This was
essentially an Intel 386with 1mb of flash memory that ran a version of
the DECTalk TTS software — to date, it still remains my favorite
Text-To-Speech engine.  At the time, I also had a software version of
the same engine running on my DEC-Alpha workstation; the desire to use
either a software or hardware solution to produce speech output defined
the Emacspeak speech-server architecture.

   I went to IBM Research in 1999; this coincided with IBM releasing a
version of the Eloquennce TTS engine on Linux under the name _ViaVoice
Outloud_.  My colleague Jeffrey Sorenson implemented an early version of
the Emacspeak speech-server for this engine using the OSS API; I later
updated it to use the ALSA library while on a flight back to SFO from
Boston in 2001.  That is still the TTS engine that is speaking as I type
this article on my laptop.

   20 years on, TTS continues to be the weakest link on Linux; the best
available solution in terms of quality continues to be the Linux port of
Eloquence TTS available from Voxin in Europe for a small price.  Looking
back across 20 years, the state of TTS on Linux in particular and across
all platforms in general continues to be a disappointment; most of
today’s newer TTS engines are geared toward mainstream use-cases where
_naturalness_ of the voice tends to supersede intelligibility at higher
speech-rates.  Ironically, modern TTS engines also give applications far
less control over the generated output — as a case in point, I
implemented Audio System For Technical Readings (AsTeR)
(http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/demo.html) in 1994 using the
DECTalk; 20 years later, we implemented MathML support
(http://allthingsd.com/20130604/t-v-ramans-audio-deja-vu-from-google-a-math-reading-system-for-the-web/)
in ChromeVox (http://www.chromevox.com/) using Google TTS. In 2013, it
turned out to be difficult or impossible to implement the type of audio
renderings that were possible with the admittedly less-natural sounding
DECTalk!

15.5 Emacspeak And Software Development
=======================================

Version 0.01 of Emacspeak was written using IBM Screen-Reader on a PC
with a terminal emulator accessing a UNIX workstation.  But in about 2
weeks, Emacspeak was already a better environment for developing
Emacspeak in particular and software development in general.  Here are a
few highlights in 1994 that made Emacspeak a good software development
environment, present-day users of Emacspeak will see that that was just
scratching the surface.

   • Audio formatting using voice-lock to provide aural syntax
     highlighting.
   • Succinct auditory icons to provide efficient feedback.
   • Emacs’ ability to navigate code structurally —
   as opposed to moving around by plain-text units such as characters,
lines and words.  S-Expressions are a major win!
   • Emacs’ ability to specialize behavior based on major and minor
     modes.
   • Ability to browse program code using tags, and getting fluent
     spoken feedback.
   • Completion *everywhere*.
   • Everything is searchable — this is a huge win when you cannot see
     the screen.
   • Interactive spell-checking using ISpell with continuous spoken
     feedback augmented by aural highlights.
   • Running code compilation and being able to jump to errors with
     spoken feedback.
   • Ability to move through diff chunks when working with source code
     and source control systems; refined diffs as provided by the
     *ediff* package when speech-enabled is a major productivity win.
   • Ability to easily move between email, document authoring and
     programming — though this may appear trivial, it continues to be
     one of Emacs’ biggest wins.

   Long-term Emacs users will recognize all of the above as being among
the reasons why they do most things inside Emacs — there is little that
is Emacspeak specific in the above list — except that Emacspeak was able
to provide fluent, well-integrated contextual feedback for all of these
tasks.  And that was a game-changer given what I had had before
Emacspeak.  As a case in point, I did not dare program in Python before
I speech-enabled Emacs’ Python-Mode; the fact that white space is
significant in Python made it difficult to program using a plain
screen-reader that was unaware of the semantics of the underlying
content being accessed.

15.5.1 Programming Defensively
------------------------------

As an aside, note that all of Emacspeak has been developed over the last
20 years with Emacspeak being the only adaptive technology on my system.
This has led to some interesting design consequences, primary among them
being a strong education in *programming defensively*.  Here are some
other key features of the Emacspeak code-base:

  1. The code-base is extremely *bushy* rather than deeply hierarchical
     — this means that when a module breaks, it does not affect the rest
     of the system.
  2. Separation of concerns with respect to the various layers, a
     tightly knit core speech library interfaces with any one of many
     speech servers running as an external process.
  3. Audio formatting is abstracted by using the formalism defined in
     Aural CSS.
  4. Emacspeak integrates with Emacs’ user interface conventions by
     taking over a single prefix key *C-e* with _all_ Emacspeak commands
     accessed through that single keymap.  This helps embedding
     Emacspeak functionality into a large variety of third party modules
     without any loss of functionality.

15.6 Emacspeak And Authoring Documents
======================================

In 1994, my preferred environment for authoring *all* documents was
*LaTeX* using the Auctex package.  Later I started writing either LaTeX
or HTML using the appropriate support modes; today I use *org-mode* to
do most of my content authoring.  Personally, I have never been a fan of
What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) authoring tools — in my
experience that places an undue burden on the author by drawing
attention away from the content to focus on the final appearance.  An
added benefit of creating content in Emacs in the form of light-weight
markup is that the content is long-lived — I can still usefully process
and re-use things I have written 25 years ago.

   Emacs, with Emacspeak providing audio formatting and context-specific
feedback remains my environment of choice for writing all forms of
content ranging from simple email messages to polished documents for
print publishing.  And it is worth repeating that I *never* need to
focus on what the content is going to look like — that job is best left
to the computer.

   As an example of producing high-fidelity visual content, see this
write-up on Polyhedral Geometry
(http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/polyhedra/) that I
published in 2002; all of the content, including the drawings were
created by me using Emacs.

15.7 Emacspeak And The Early Days Of The Web
============================================

Right around the time that I was writing version 0.01 of emacspeak, a
far more significant software movement was under way — the World Wide
Web was moving from the realms of academia to the mainstream world with
the launch of NCSA Mosaic — and in late 1994 by the first commercial Web
browser in Netscape Navigator.  Emacs had always enabled integrated
access to FTP archives via package _ange-ftp_; in late 1993, William
Perry released Emacs-W3, a Web browser for Emacs written entirely in
Emacs Lisp.  W3 was one of the first large packages to be speech-enabled
by Emacspeak — later it was the browser on which I implemented the first
draft of the Aural CSS specification
(http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/aural.html).  Emacs-W3 enabled many early
innovations in the context of providing non-visual access to Web
content, including audio formatting and structured content navigation;
in summer of 1995, Dave Raggett and I outlined a few extensions to HTML
Forms, including the *label* element as a means of associating metadata
with interactive form controls in HTML, and many of these ideas were
prototyped in Emacs-W3 at the time.  Over the years, Emacs-W3 fell
behind the times — especially as the Web moved away from cleanly
structured HTML to a massive soup of unmatched tags.  This made parsing
and error-correcting badly-formed HTML markup expensive to do in
Emacs-Lisp — and performance suffered.  To add to this, mainstream users
moved away because Emacs’ rendering engine at the time was not rich
enough to provide the type of visual renderings that users had come to
expect.  The advent of DHTML, and JavaScript based Web Applications
finally killed off Emacs-W3 as far as most Emacs users were concerned.

   But Emacs-W3 went through a revival on the emacspeak audio desktop in
late 1999 with the arrival of XSLT, and Daniel Veillard’s excellent
implementation via the *libxml2* and *libxslt* packages.  With these in
hand, Emacspeak was able to hand-off the bulk of HTML error correction
to the *xsltproc* tool.  The lack of visual fidelity didn’t matter much
for an eyes-free environment; so Emacs-W3 continued to be a useful tool
for consuming large amounts of Web content that did not require
JavaScript support.

   During the last 24 months, *libxml2* has been built into Emacs; this
means that you can now parse arbitrary HTML as found in the wild without
incurring a performance hit.  This functionality was leveraged first by
package *shr* (Simple HTML Renderer) within the *gnus* package for
rendering HTML email.  Later, the author of *gnus* and *shr* created a
new light-weight HTML viewer called *eww* that is now part of Emacs 24.
With improved support for variable pitch fonts and image embedding,
Emacs is once again able to provide visual renderings for a large
proportion of text-heavy Web content where it becomes useful for
mainstream Emacs users to view at least some Web content within Emacs;
during the last year, I have added support within emacspeak to extend
package *eww*
(http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2014/05/emacspeak-eww-updates-for-complete.html)
with support for DOM filtering and quick content navigation.

15.8 Audio Formatting — Generalizing Aural CSS
==============================================

A key idea in Audio System For Technical Readings (AsTeR)
(http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html) was the
use of various voice properties in combination with non-speech auditory
icons to create rich aural renderings.  When I implemented Emacspeak, I
brought over the notion of audio formatting to all buffers in Emacs by
creating a *voice-lock* module that paralleled Emacs’ *font-lock*
module.  The visual medium is far richer in terms of available fonts and
colors as compared to voice parameters available on TTS engines —
consequently, it did not make sense to directly map Emacs’ *face*
properties to voice parameters.  To aid in projecting visual formatting
onto auditory space, I created property *personality* analogous to
Emacs’ *face* property that could be applied to content displayed in
Emacs; module *voice-lock* applied that property appropriately, and the
Emacspeak core handled the details of mapping personality values to the
underlying TTS engine.

   The values used in property *personality* were abstract, i.e., they
were independent of any given speech engine.  Later in the fall of 1995,
I re-expressed these set of abstract voice properties in terms of Aural
CSS; the work was published as a first draft toward the end of 1995, and
implemented in Emacs-W3 in early 1996.  Aural CSS was an appendix in the
CSS-1.0 specification; later, it graduated to being its own module
within CSS-2.0.

   Later in 1996, all of Emacs’ *voice-lock* functionality was
re-implemented in terms of Aural CSS; the implementation has stood the
test of time in that as I added support for more TTS engines, I was able
to implement engine-specific mappings of Aural-CSS values.  This meant
that the rest of Emacspeak could define various types of voices for use
in specific contexts without having to worry about individual TTS
engines.  Conceptually, property *personality* can be thought of as
holding an *aural display list* — various parts of the system can
annotate pieces of text with relevant properties that finally get
rendered in the aggregate.  This model also works well with the notion
of Emacs overlays where a moving overlay is used to temporarily
highlight text that has other context-specific properties applied to it.

   Audio formatting as implemented in Emacspeak is extremely effective
when working with all types of content ranging from richly structured
mark-up documents (LaTeX, org-mode) and formatted Web pages to program
source code.  Perceptually, switching to audio formatted output feels
like switching from a black-and-white monitor to a rich color display.
Today, Emacspeak’s audio formatted output is the only way I can
correctly write *else if* vs *elsif* in various programming languages!

15.9 Conversational Gestures For The Audio Desktop
==================================================

By 1996, Emacspeak was the only piece of adaptive technology I used; in
fall of 1995, I had moved to Adobe Systems from DEC Research to focus on
enhancing the Portable Document Format (PDF) to make PDF content
repurposable.  Between 1996 and 1998, I was primarily focused on
electronic document formats — I took this opportunity to step back and
evaluate what I had built as an auditory interface within Emacspeak.
This retrospect proved extremely useful in gaining a sense of
perspective and led to formalizing the high-level concept of
_Conversational Gestures_ and structured browsing/searching as a means
of thinking about user interfaces.

   By now, Emacspeak was a complete environment — I formalized what it
provided under the moniker _Complete Audio Desktop_.  The fully
integrated user experience allowed me to move forward with respect to
defining interaction models that were highly optimized to eyes-free
interaction — as an example, see how Emacspeak interfaces with modes
like *dired* (Directory Editor) for browsing and manipulating the
filesystem, or *proced* (Process Editor) for browsing and manipulating
running processes.  Emacs’ integration with *ispell* for spell checking,
as well as its various completion facilities ranging from minibuffer
completion to other forms of dynamic completion while typing text
provided more opportunities for creating innovative forms of eyes-free
interaction.  With respect to what had gone before (and is still par for
the course as far as traditional screen-readers are concerned), these
types of highly dynamic interfaces present a challenge.  For example,
consider handling a completion interface using a screen-reader that is
speaking the visual display.  There is a significant challenge in
deciding _what to speak_ e.g., when presented with a list of
completions, the currently typed text, and the default completion, which
of these should you speak, and in what order?  The problem gets harder
when you consider that the underlying semantics of these items is
generally not available from examining the visual presentation in a
consistent manner.  By having direct access to the underlying
information being presented, Emacspeak had a leg up with respect to
addressing the higher-level question — when you do have access to this
information, how do you present it effectively in an eyes-free
environment?  For this and many other cases of dynamic interaction, a
combination of audio formatting, auditory icons, and the ability to
synthesize succinct messages from a combination of information items —
rather than having to forcibly speak each item as it is rendered
visually provided for highly efficient eyes-free interaction.

   This was also when I stepped back to build out Emacspeak’s table
browsing facilities — see the online Emacspeak documentation for details
on Emacspeak’s table browsing functionality which continues to remain
one of the richest collection of end-user affordances for working with
two-dimensional data.

15.9.1 Speech-Enabling Interactive Games
----------------------------------------

So in 1997, I went the next step in asking — given access to the
underlying infromation, is it possible to build effective eyes-free
interaction to highly interactive tasks?  I picked *Tetris* as a means
of exploring this space, the result was an Emacspeak extension to
speech-enable module *tetris.el*.  The details of what was learned were
published as a paper in Assets 98, and expanded as a chapter on
Conversational Gestures in my book on Auditory Interfaces; that book was
in a sense a culmination of stepping back and gaining a sense of
perspective of what I had build during this period.  The work on
Conversational Gestures also helped in formalizing the abstract user
interface layer that formed part of the XForms
(http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/) work at the W3C.

   Speech-enabling games for effective eyes-free interaction has proven
highly educational.  Interactive games are typically built to challenge
the user, and if the eyes-free interface is inefficient, you just wont
play the game — contrast this with a task that you *must* perform, where
you’re likely to make do with a sub-optimal interface.  Over the years,
Emacspeak has come to include eyes-free interfaces to several games
including Tetris (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris), Sudoku
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)), and of late the
popular 2048 game (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)).
Each of these have in turn contributed to enhancing the interaction
model in Emacspeak, and those innovations typically make their way to
the rest of the environment.

15.10 Accessing Media Streams
=============================

Streaming real-time audio on the Internet became a reality with the
advent of RealAudio in 1995; soon there were a large number of media
streams available on the Internet ranging from music streams to live
radio stations.  But there was an interesting twist — for the most part,
all of these media streams expected one to look at the screen, even
though the primary content was purely audio (streaming video hadn’t
arrived yet!).  Starting in 1996, Emacspeak started including a variety
of eyes-free front-ends for accessing media streams.  Initially, this
was achieved by building a wrapper around *trplayer* — a headless
version of RealPlayer; later I built Emacspeak module
*emacspeak-m-player* for interfacing with package *mplayer*.  A key
aspect of streaming media integration in emacspeak is that one can
launch and control streams without ever switching away from one’s
primary task; thus, you can continue to type email or edit code while
seamlessly launching and controlling media streams.  Over the years,
Emacspeak has come to integrate with Emacs packages like *emms* as well
as providing wrappers for *mplayer* and *alsaplayer* — collectively,
these let you efficiently launch all types of media streams, including
streaming video, without having to explicitly switch context.

   In the mid-90’s, Emacspeak started including a directory of media
links to some of the more popular radio stations — primarily as a means
of helping users getting started — Emacs’ ability to rapidly complete
directory and file-names turned out to be the most effective means of
quickly launching everything from streaming radio stations to audio
books.  And even better — as the Emacs community develops better and
smarter ways of navigating the filesystem using completions, e.g.,
package *ido*, these types of actions become even more efficient!

15.11 EBooks — Ubiquitous Access To Books
=========================================

AsTeR — was motivated by the increasing availability of technical
material as online electronic documents.  While AsTeR processed the TeX
family of markup languages, more general ebooks came in a wide range of
formats, ranging from plain text generated from various underlying file
formats to structured EBooks, with Project Gutenberg
(http://www.gutenberg.org/) leading the way.  During the mid-90’s, I had
access to a wide range of electronic materials from sources such as
O’Reilly Publishing and various electronic journals — The Perl Journal
(TPJ) is one that I still remember fondly.

   Emacspeak provided fairly light-weight but efficient access to all of
the electronic books I had on my local disk — Emacs’ strengths with
respect to browsing textual documents meant that I needed to build
little that was specific to Emacspeak.  The late 90’s saw the arrival of
Daisy as an XML-based format for accessible electronic books.  The last
decade has seen the rapid convergence to *epub* as a distribution format
of choice for electronic books.  Emacspeak provides interaction modes
that make organizing, searching and reading these materials on the
Emacspeak Audio Desktop a pleasant experience.  Emacspeak also provides
an OCR-Mode — this enables one to call out to an external OCR program
and read the content efficiently.

   The somewhat informal process used by publishers like O’Reilly to
make technical material available to users with print impairments was
later formalized by BookShare (https://www.bookshare.org/) — today,
qualified users can obtain a large number of books and periodicals
initially as Daisy-3 and increasingly as *EPub*.  BookShare provides a
RESTful API for searching and downloading books; Emacspeak module
*emacspeak-bookshare* implements this API to create a client for
browsing the BookShare library, downloading and organizing books
locally, and an integrated ebook reading mode to round off the
experience.

   A useful complement to this suite of tools is the Calibre package for
organizing ones ebook collection; Emacspeak now implements an *EPub
Interaction* mode that leverages Calibre (actually sqlite3) to search
and browse books, along with an integrated *EPub mode* for reading
books.

15.12 Leveraging Computational Tools — From SQL And R To IPython Notebooks
==========================================================================

The ability to invoke external processes and interface with them via a
simple read-eval-loop (REPL) is perhaps one of Emacs’ strongest
extension points.  This means that a wide variety of computational tools
become immediately available for embedding within the Emacs environment
— a facility that has been widely exploited by the Emacs community.
Over the years, Emacspeak has leveraged many of these facilities to
provide a well-integrated auditory interface.

   Starting from a tight code, eval, test form of iterative programming
as encouraged by Lisp.  Applied to languages like Python and Ruby to
exploratory computational tools such as R for data analysis and SQL for
database interaction, the Emacspeak Audio Desktop has come to encompass
a collection of rich computational tools that provide an efficient
eyes-free experience.

   In this context, module *ein* — Emacs IPython Notebooks — provides
another excellent example of an Emacs tool that helps interface
seamlessly with others in the technical domain.  IPython Notebooks
provide an easy means of reaching a large audience when publishing
technical material with interactive computational content; module *ein*
brings the power and convenience of Emacs ’ editting facilities when
developing the content.  Speech-enabling package *ein* is a major win
since editting program source code in an eyes-free environment is far
smoother in Emacs than in a browser-based editor.

15.13 Social Web — EMail, Instant Messaging, Blogging And Tweeting Using Open Protocols
=======================================================================================

The ability to process large amounts of email and electronic news has
always been a feature of Emacs.  I started using package *vm* for email
in 1990, along with *gnus* for Usenet access many years before
developing Emacspeak.  So these were the first major packages that
Emacspeak speech-enabled.  Being able to access the underlying data
structures used to visually render email messages and Usenet articles
enabled Emacspeak to produce rich, succinct auditory output — this
vastly increased my ability to consume and organize large amounts of
information.  Toward the turn of the century, instant messaging arrived
in the mainstream — package *tnt* provided an Emacs implementation of a
chat client that could communicate with users on the then popular AOL
Instant Messenger platform.  At the time, I worked at IBM Research, and
inspired by package *tnt*, I created an Emacs client called *ChatterBox*
using the Lotus Sametime API — this enabled me to communicate with
colleagues at work from the comfort of Emacs.  Packages like *vm*,
*gnus*, *tnt* and *ChatterBox* provide an interesting example of how
availability of a clean underlying API to a specific service or content
stream can encourage the creation of efficient (and different) user
interfaces.  The touchstone of such successful implementations is a
simple test — can the user of a specific interface tell if the person
whom he is communicating with is also using the same interface?  In each
of the examples enumerated above, a user at one end of the communication
chain cannot tell, and in fact shouldn’t be able to tell what client the
user at the other end is using.  Contrast this with closed services that
have an inherent _lock-in_ model e.g., proprietary word processors that
use undocumented serialization formats — for a fun read, see this
write-up on Universe Of Fancy Colored Paper
(http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/publications/colored-paper.html).

   Today, my personal choice for instant messaging is the open Jabber
platform.  I connect to Jabber via Emacs package *emacs-jabber* and with
Emacspeak providing a light-weight wrapper for generating the eyes-free
interface, I can communicate seamlessly with colleagues and friends
around the world.

   As the Web evolved to encompass ever-increasing swathes of
communication functionality that had already been available on the
Internet, we saw the world move from Usenet groups to *Blogs* — I
remember initially dismissing the blogging phenomenon as just a
re-invention of Usenet in the early days.  However, mainstream users
flocked to Blogging, and I later realized that blogging as a publishing
platform brought along interesting features that made communicating and
publishing information *much* easier.  In 2005, I joined Google; during
the winter holidays that year, I implemented a light-weight client for
Blogger that became the start of Emacs package *g-client* — this package
provides Emacs wrappers for Google services that provide a RESTful API.

15.14 The RESTful Web — Web Wizards And URL Templates For Faster Access
=======================================================================

Today, the Web, based on URLs and HTTP-style protocols is widely
recognized as a platform in its own right.  This platform emerged over
time — to me, Web APIs arrived in the late 90’s when I observed the
following with respect to my own behavior on many popular sites:

  1. I opened a Web page that took a while to load (remember, I was
     still using Emacs-W3),
  2. I then searched through the page to find a form-field that I filled
     out, e.g., start and end destinations on Yahoo Maps,
  3. I hit *submit*, and once again waited for a heavy-weight HTML page
     to load,
  4. And finally, I hunted through the rendered content to find what I
     was looking for.

   This pattern repeated across a wide-range of interactive Web sites
ranging from AltaVista for search (this was pre-Google), Yahoo Maps for
directions, and Amazon for product searches to name but a few.  So I
decided to automate away the pain by creating Emacspeak module
*emacspeak-websearch* that did the following:

  1. Prompt via the minibuffer for the requisite fields,
  2. Consed up an HTTP GET URL,
  3. Retrieved this URL,
  4. And filtered out the specific portion of the HTML DOM that held the
     generated response.

   Notice that the above implementation hard-wires the CGI parameter
names used by a given Web application into the code implemented in
module *emacspeak-websearch*.  REST as a design pattern had not yet been
recognized, leave alone formalized, and module *emacspeak-websearch* was
initially criticized as being fragile.

   However, over time, the CGI parameter names remained fixed — the only
things that have required updating in the Emacspeak code-base are the
content filtering rules that extract the response — for popular
services, this has averaged about one to two times a year.

   I later codified these filtering rules in terms of XPath, and also
integrated XSLT-based pre-processing of incoming HTML content before it
got handed off to Emacs-W3 — and yes, Emacs/Advice once again came in
handy with respect to injecting XSLT pre-processing into Emacs-W3!

   Later, in early 2000, I created companion module
*emacspeak-url-templates* — partially inspired by Emacs’ *webjump*
module.  URL templates in Emacspeak leveraged the recognized REST
interaction pattern to provide a large collection of Web widgets that
could be quickly invoked to provide rapid access to the right pieces of
information on the Web.

   The final icing on the cake was the arrival of RSS and Atom feeds and
the consequent deep-linking into content-rich sites — this meant that
Emacspeak could provide audio renderings of useful content without
having to deal with complex visual navigation!  While Google Reader
existed, Emacspeak provided a light-weight *greader* client for managing
ones feed subscriptions; with the demise of Google Reader, I implemented
module *emacspeak-feeds* for organizing feeds on the Emacspeak desktop.
A companion package *emacspeak-webspace* implements additional goodies
including a continuously updating ticker of headlines taken from the
user’s collection of subscribed feeds.

15.15 Mashing It Up — Leveraging Evolving Web APIs
==================================================

The next step in this evolution came with the arrival of richer Web APIs
— especially ones that defined a clean client/server separation.  In
this respect, the world of Web APIs is a somewhat mixed bag in that many
Web sites equate a Web API with a JS-based API that can be exclusively
invoked from within a Web-Browser run-time.  The issue with that type of
API binding is that the only runtime that is supported is a full-blown
Web browser; but the arrival of native mobile apps has actually proven a
net positive in encouraging sites to create a cleaner separation.
Emacspeak has leveraged these APIs to create Emacspeak front-ends to
many useful services, here are a few:

  1. Minibuffer completion for Google Search using Google Suggest to
     provide completions.
  2. Librivox for browsing and playing free audio books.
  3. NPR for browsing and playing NPR archived programs.
  4. BBC for playing a wide variety of streaming content available from
     the BBC.
  5. A Google Maps front-end that provides instantaneous access to
     directions and Places search.
  6. Access to Twitter via package *twittering-mode*.

   And a lot more than will fit this margin!  This is an example of
generalizing the concept of a mashup as seen on the Web with respect to
creating hybrid applications by bringing together a collection of
different Web APIs.  Another way to think of such separation is to view
an application as a *head* and a *body* — where the *head* is a specific
user interface, with the *body* implementing the application logic.  A
cleanly defined separation between the *head* and *body* allows one to
attach _different_ user interfaces i.e., *heads* to the given *body*
without any loss of functionality, or the need to re-implement the
entire application.  Modern platforms like Android enable such
separation via an Intent
(http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html)
mechanism.  The Web platform as originally defined around URLs is
actually well-suited to this type of separation — though the full
potential of this design pattern remains to be fully realized given
today’s tight association of the Web to the Web Browser.

15.16 Conclusion — Turning Twenty
=================================

In 1996, I wrote an article entitled User Interface — A Means To An End
(http://www.drdobbs.com/user-interface-a-means-to-an-end/184410453)
pointing out that the size and shape of computers were determined by the
keyboard and display.  This is even more true in today’s world of
tablets, phablets and large-sized phones — with the only difference that
the keyboard has been replaced by a touch screen.  The next generation
in the evolution of *personal* devices is that they will become truly
personal by being wearables — this once again forces a separation of the
user interface peripherals from the underlying compute engine.  Imagine
a variety of wearables that collectively connect to ones cell phone,
which itself connects to the cloud for all its computational and
information needs.  Such an environment is rich in possibilities for
creating a wide variety of user experiences to a single underlying body
of information; Eyes-Free interfaces as pioneered by systems like
Emacspeak will come to play an increasingly vital role alongside visual
interaction when this comes to pass.

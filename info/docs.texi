@node acss-structure
@section acss-structure

The CSS Speech Style Sheet specification defines a number of
abstract device independent voice properties.
A setting conforming to the CSS speech specification can be
represented in elisp as a structure.

We will refer to this structure as a "speech style".
This structure needs to be mapped to device dependent codes to
produce the desired effect.
This module forms a bridge between User Agents e.g. Emacs-w3 that
wish to implement a speech style sheet
and Emacspeak's dectalk-voices module.
Emacspeak produces voice change effects by examining the value of
text-property 'personality.

Think of a buffer of formatted text along with the text-property
'personality appropriately set as a "aural display list".
Applications like W3 that produce such formatted buffers  call function
acss-personality-from-speech-style  with a  "speech-style"
--a structure as defined in this module and get back a symbol that
they then assign to the value of property 'personality.
Emacspeak's rendering engine then does the needful at the time
speech is produced.
Function acss-personality-from-speech-style does the following:
Takes as input a "speech style"
(1)  Computes a symbol that will be used henceforth to refer to this
specific speech style.
(2) Examines emacspeak's internal voice table to see if this
speech style has a voice already defined.
If so it returns immediately.
Otherwise, it does the additional work of defining a dectalk-voice for
future use.
See module dectalk-voices.el to see how voices are defined.

@node congrats
@section congrats

CONGRATS ==  Convert Graphics To Sound
I first implemented this idea in late   1988 for my final year project at IIT Bombay.
A scaled-down version of this project was submitted to the John Hopkins  National Search  in 1991
See  @url{http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/publications/ieee-congrats.ps}
Congrats was originally implemented on a BBC Micro with 32K of memory.
This module provides data sonification services for the Emacspeak Audio Desktop
in the spirit of Congrats --- it uses package siggen --- and specifically, the tones utility from that package for generating the auditory output.
Note that  the original version of CONGRATS  enabled  multiple types of "scans"
you could listen to a curve in terms of Cartesian or Polar coordinates.

@node dectalk-voices
@section dectalk-voices

This module defines the various voices used in voice-lock mode.
This module is Dectalk specific.

@subsection dectalk-voices Commands

@deffn {Command} dectalk   
@kbd{C-e d C-d}

@kindex C-e d C-d
@findex dectalk

Select Dectalk TTS server.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} dtk-exp   
@findex dtk-exp

Select Dectalk TTS server.
@end deffn

@node dom
@section dom

@node dom-addons
@section dom-addons

Useful additional functions for dom.el

@node dtk-interp
@section dtk-interp

All requests to the speech server are factored out into
this module.
These calls are declared here as defsubst so they are
inlined by the byte compiler.
This  keeps the code efficient,
but gives us the flexibility to call out to different
speech servers.

@node dtk-speak
@section dtk-speak

Defines the TTS interface.

@subsection dtk-speak Commands

@deffn {Command} dtk-add-cleanup-pattern  (&optional delete)
@kbd{C-e d a}

@kindex C-e d a
@findex dtk-add-cleanup-pattern

Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that
are cleaned up.  Optional interactive prefix arg deletes
this pattern if previously added.  Cleaning up repeated
patterns results in emacspeak speaking the pattern followed
by a repeat count instead of speaking all the characters
making up the pattern.  Thus, by adding the repeating
pattern `.' (this is already added by default) emacspeak
will say ``aw fifteen dot'' when speaking the string
``...............'' instead of ``period period period period
''
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space   
@kbd{C-e d SPC}

@kindex C-e d SPC
@findex dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space

Toggle splitting of speech on white space.
This affects the internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split
text purely by clause boundaries, or also include
whitespace.  By default, emacspeak sends a clause at a time
to the speech device.  This produces fluent speech for
normal use.  However in modes such as `shell-mode' and some
programming language modes, clause markers appear
infrequently, and this can result in large amounts of text
being sent to the speech device at once, making the system
unresponsive when asked to stop talking.  Splitting on white
space makes emacspeak's stop command responsive.  However,
when splitting on white space, the speech sounds choppy
since the synthesizer is getting a word at a time.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} dtk-toggle-strip-octals  (&optional prefix)
@kbd{C-e d o}

@kindex C-e d o
@findex dtk-toggle-strip-octals

List of repeating patterns to clean up.
You can use  command  `dtk-add-cleanup-pattern'
 bound to C-e d a  to add more patterns.
Specify patterns that people use to decorate their ASCII files, and cause
untold pain to the speech synthesizer.

If more than 3 consecutive occurrences
of a specified pattern is found, the TTS engine replaces it
with a repeat count. 

@end defvar

Set this to t to avoid a dectalk bug that makes the speech box die if
it seems some accented characters in certain contexts.

@end defvar

@defvar {User Option} dtk-speech-rate-base
*Value of lowest tolerable speech rate.

@end defvar

@defvar {User Option} dtk-speech-rate-step

@node emacspeak
@section emacspeak

The complete audio desktop.

Emacspeak extends Emacs to be a fully functional audio desktop.
This is the main emacspeak module.
It actually does very little:
It loads the various parts of the system.

@subsection emacspeak Commands

@deffn {Command} emacspeak   
@findex emacspeak

Starts the Emacspeak speech subsystem.  Use emacs as you
normally would, emacspeak will provide you spoken feedback
as you work.  Emacspeak also provides commands for having
parts of the current buffer, the mode-line etc to be spoken.

If you are hearing this description as a result of pressing
C-h C-e you may want to press
C-e s to stop speech, and then use the arrow keys to
move around in the Help buffer to read the rest of this
description, which includes a summary of all emacspeak
keybindings.

All emacspeak commands use C-e as a
prefix key.  You can also set the state of the TTS engine  by
using C-e d as a prefix.  Here is
a summary of all emacspeak commands along with their
bindings.  You need to precede the keystrokes listed below
with C-e.

Emacspeak also provides a fluent speech extension to the
emacs terminal emulator (eterm).  Note: You need to use the
term package that comes with emacs-19.29 and later.

@node emacspeak-advice
@section emacspeak-advice

This module defines the advice forms for making the core of Emacs speak
Advice forms that are specific to Emacs subsystems do not belong here!
I violate this at present by advising completion comint and
shell here.

Note that we needed to advice a lot more for Emacs 19 and
Emacs 20 than we do for Emacs 21 and Emacs 22.
As of August 2007, this file is being purged of advice forms
not needed in Emacs 22.
This also means that this and subsequent versions of
Emacspeak should not be run on versions of Emacs older than
Emacs 21,
And preferably only run on Emacs 22.
This version of Emacspeak is only tested on Emacs 24 and later.

@section emacspeak-bbc

BBC: http://www.bbc.co.uk
This module uses
publicly available REST APIs to implement a native Emacs
client for browsing and listening to BBC programs.

See http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/developers
The BBC API helps locate a PID for a given program stream.
We then construct the BBC IPlayer URL for that  PID,
And either hand that link off to Chrome,
Or stream it via get_iplayer and mplayer.
get_iplayer: https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer.git
get_player vs Chrome: Pro/Con:
Chrome: Has the UI for seeking in the stream.
get_iplayer: We use a named pipe, and cannot seek,
but the rest of emacspeak-m-player is available.
For downloading a program etc., use Emacs package iplayer.

Ediff provides a nice visual interface to diff. ;;;Comparing and
patching files is easy with ediff when you can see the screen.
This module provides Emacspeak extensions to work fluently
with ediff. Try it out, it's an excellent example of why
Emacspeak is better than a traditional screenreader. This module
was originally written to interface to the old ediff.el bundled
with GNU Emacs 19.28 and earlier. It has been updated to work
with the newer and much larger ediff system found in Emacs 19.29
and later.

@section emacspeak-epub

In celebration of a million books and more to read from
Google Books
The EPubs format is slightly simpler than full Daisy ---
(see) emacspeak-daisy.el
Since it only needs one level of indirection (no audio,
therefore no smil). This module is consequently simpler than
emacspeak-daisy.el.
This module will eventually  implement the Google Books  API
--- probably by invoking the yet-to-be-written gbooks.el in emacs-g-client
As we move to epub-3, this module will bring back audio layers etc., perhaps via a simplified smil implementation.

@node emacspeak-gridtext
@section emacspeak-gridtext

Emacspeak's table browsing mode allows one to
efficiently access  content that is tabular in nature.
That module also provides functions for inferring table
structure where possible.
Often, such structure is hard to infer automatically
--but might be known to the user 
e.g. treat columns 1 through 30 as one column of a table
and so on.
This module allows the user to specify a conceptual grid
that is "overlaid" on the region of text to turn it into
a table for tabular browsing. For now, elements of the
grid are "one line" high --but that may change in the
future if necessary. This module is useful for browsing
structured text files and the output from programs that
tabulate their output.
It's also useful for handling multicolumn text.

This command either hides or exposes a block of text
starting on the current line.  A block of text is defined as
a portion of the buffer in which all lines start with a
common PREFIX.  Optional interactive prefix arg causes all
blocks in current buffer to be hidden or exposed.

@section emacspeak-ocr

This module defines Emacspeak front-end to OCR.
This module assumes that sane is installed and working
for image acquisition,
and that there is an OCR engine that can take acquired
images and produce text.
Prerequisites:
Sane installed and working.
scanimage to generate tiff files from scanner.
tiffcp to compress the tiff file.
working ocr executable 
by default this module assumes that the OCR executable
is named "ocr"

@subsection emacspeak-ocr Commands

@deffn {Command} emacspeak-ocr   
@kbd{C-e C-o}

@kindex C-e C-o
@findex emacspeak-ocr

An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.  

Page image is acquired using tools from the SANE package.
The acquired image is run through the OCR engine if one is
available, and the results placed in a buffer that is
suitable for browsing the results.

For detailed help, invoke command emacspeak-ocr bound to
C-e C-o to launch emacspeak-ocr-mode, and press
`?' to display mode-specific help for emacspeak-ocr-mode.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} emacspeak-ocr-backward-page  (&optional count-ignored)
@findex emacspeak-ocr-backward-page

Like backward page, but tracks page number of current document.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} emacspeak-ocr-customize   
@findex emacspeak-ocr-customize

Customize OCR settings.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image   
@findex emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image

Run OCR engine on current image after flip-flopping it.
Useful if you've scanned a page upside down and are using an engine that does not automatically flip the image for you.
You need the imagemagik family of tools --- we use mogrify to transform the image.
Prompts for image file if file corresponding to the expected
`current page' is not found.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} emacspeak-ocr-forward-page  (&optional count-ignored)
@findex emacspeak-ocr-forward-page

Like forward page, but tracks page number of current document.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} emacspeak-ocr-mode   
@findex emacspeak-ocr-mode

 An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

Pre-requisites:

1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

2) An OCR engine.

1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have
the utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a
tiff file.  Then set variable
emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at this utility.
By default, this is set to `scanimage' which is the image
scanning utility provided by SANE.

By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired
tiff image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.
Variable emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to `tiffcp' by
default; if you use something else, you should customize
this variable.

2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and
working.  By default this front-end assumes that OCR is
available as /usr/bin/ocr.

Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying
OCR to it work independently of Emacs, you can use this
Emacspeak front-end to enable easy OCR access from within
Emacspeak.

The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command
emacspeak-ocr bound to C-e C-o.  

This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR
commands bounds to single keystrokes-- see the key-binding
list at the end of this description.  Use Emacs online help
facility to look up help on these commands.

emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to
scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned
images and the resulting text are saved under directory
~/ocr; see variable emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.
Invoking command emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound
to M-x emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory will open this directory.

By default, the document being scanned is named `untitled'.
You can name the document by using command
emacspeak-ocr-name-document bound to
M-x emacspeak-ocr-name-document.  The document name is used
in constructing the name of the image and text files.

@node emacspeak-pronounce
@section emacspeak-pronounce

This module implements user customizable pronunciation dictionaries
for emacspeak. Custom pronunciations can be defined per file, per
directory and/or per major mode. Emacspeak maintains a persistent
user dictionary upon request and loads these in new emacspeak
sessions. This module implements the user interface to the custom
dictionary as well as providing the internal API used by the rest
of emacspeak in using the dictionary.
Algorithm:

The persistent dictionary is a hash table where the hash keys are
filenames, directory names, or major-mode names. The hash values
are association lists defining the dictionary. Users of this module
can retrieve a dictionary made up of all applicable association
lists for a given file.

Pronunciations are activated on a per buffer basis.
Turning on the use of pronunciation dictionaries results in emacspeak
composing a pronunciation table based on the currently defined
pronunciation dictionaries.
After this, the pronunciations will be applied whenever text in the
buffer is spoken.
Optional argument state can be used from Lisp programs to
explicitly turn pronunciations on or off.

@node emacspeak-sounds
@section emacspeak-sounds

This module provides the interface for generating auditory icons in emacspeak.
Design goal:
1) Auditory icons should be used to provide additional feedback,
not as a gimmick.
2) The interface should be usable at all times without the icons:
e.g. when on a machine without a sound card.
3) General principle for when to use an icon:
Convey information about events taking place in parallel.
For instance, if making a selection automatically moves the current focus
to the next choice,
We speak the next choice, while indicating the fact that something was selected with a sound cue.
 This interface will assume the availability of a shell command "play"
that can take one or more sound files and play them.
This module will also provide a mapping between names in the elisp world and actual sound files.
Modules that wish to use auditory icons should use these names, instead of actual file names.
As of Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a themes
architecture for  auditory icons.
Sound files corresponding to a given theme are found in
appropriate subdirectories of emacspeak-sounds-directory

This is a bit of toy code to write in braille.

To try this, load this file (`M-x load-file path/to/toy-braille.el'), then do:

  M-: (get-toy-braille-string "just a test")

That's just a toy, meant as an excuse and maybe a tool to learn a
bit of braille, nothing more.

Unicode fonts are needed.

You can try:

  M-: (set-default-font "-*-unifont-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*")

or

  M-: (set-default-font "-*-clearlyu-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-*")

(it will only work if the relative font is installed and properly configured).

@node voice-setup
@section voice-setup

A voice is to audio as a font is to a visual display.
A personality is to audio as a face is to a visual display.

Voice-lock-mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to be
spoken in one personality, strings in another, reserved words in another,
documentation strings in another, and so on.

Comments will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality'.
Strings will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-string-personality'.
Function and variable names (in their defining forms) will be
 spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-function-name-personality'.
Reserved words will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-keyword-personality'.

To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x voice-lock-mode.
When this minor mode is on, the voices of the current line are
updated with every insertion or deletion.

How faces map to voices: TTS engine specific modules e.g.,
dectalk-voices.el and outloud-voices.el define a standard set
of voice names.  This module maps standard "personality"
names to these pre-defined voices.  It does this via special
form def-voice-font which takes a personality name, a voice
name and a face name to set up the mapping between face and
personality, and personality and voice.
Newer Emacspeak modules should use voice-setup-add-map when
defining face->personality mappings.
Older code calls def-voice-font directly, but over time those
calls will be changed to the more succinct form provided by
voice-setup-add-map. For use from other modules, also see
function voice-setup-map-face which is useful when mapping a
single face.
Both voice-setup-add-map and voice-setup-map-face call
special form def-voice-font.

Special form def-voice-font sets up the personality name to
be available via custom.  new voices can be defined using CSS
style specifications see special form defvoice Voices defined
via defvoice can be customized via custom see the
documentation for defvoice.

@heading Overview

This chapter documents the various Emacspeak modules and is
auto-generated from the Emacspeak source code.  It is meant to be a
complete reference to the emacspeak implementation while also
providing high-level usage summaries of some of the larger Emacspeak
modules.

Each section provides a high-level overview of that module, followed by
detailed description of the commands and options defined in that module.

Emacspeak modules can be classified as follows:
@enumerate
@item
Modules that interface with various TTS engines,
e.g. @code{espeak-voices} and @code{dectalk-voices}.

@item
Modules that implement core Emacspeak functionality, e.g.,
@code{emacspeak-speak}, @code{emacspeak-keymap}, @code{voice-lock} and
@code{emacspeak-advice}.

@item
Emacspeak extensions that speech-enable various emacs packages, these
are all named using the convention @code{emacspeak-@var{<packagename>}}.
@end enumerate

The first two of the above are mostly of interest when extending
Emacspeak, or to learn how things are implemented.  The third category
is useful in understanding how emacspeak works with a given package;
thus, when learning to use the Emacs Web Browser (@acronym{EWW}), read
the @xref{EWW,,,emacs} documentation, then  @xref{emacspeak-eww}.

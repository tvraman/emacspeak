This chapter documents the various Emacspeak modules and is
auto-generated from the Emacspeak source code.
Each section provides a high-level overview of that module, followed by
detailed description of the commands and options defined in that module.




Emacspeak modules can be classified as follows:
@itemize 
@item  Modules that interface with various TTS engines,
e.g. @code{espeak-voices} and @code{dectalk-voices}.
@item Modules that implement core Emacspeak functionality, e.g.,
@code{emacspeak-speak}, @code{voice-lock} and @code{emacspeak-voices}.
@item Emacspeak extensions for speech-enabling various emacs packages,
 these are all named using the convention @code{emacspeak-<mpackagename>}.
@end itemize 

The first two of the above are mostly of interest when extending
Emacspeak, or to learn how things are implemented. The third category is
useful in understanding how emacspeak works with a given package; thus,
when learning to use the Emacs Web Browser (EWW), read the EWW
documentation, then read @xref{emacspeak-eww}.

@section Quick Installation


Here are the quick installation instructions.
See the next section for detailed installation instructions.



Packages for  Linux distributions such as Debian typically become
available on the WWW a few weeks or months  after a new version is released.
The instructions below are for building and installing Emacspeak from
the source distribution. If you install one of the pre-packaged
distributions, use the install instructions that come with that package.


@itemize @bullet
@item 
Obtain the source code @MDash  either by downloading the tar.bz2 file for the latest release @MDash  or by cloning the git repository.
@samp{git clone https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak}
@item
Change to the @code{emacspeak} directory.
 Type @samp{make config} to configure the sources.
@item
 Type 
@example
make
@end example
 to compile the files.
@item Next, decide which text-to-speech engine you will be using, and
proceed to install that engine. Your choices are:
@itemize @bullet
@item Open Source ESpeak on Linux. Install the ESpeak packages for your
system, then compile the Emacspeak ESpeak server by doing:
@example
cd servers/linux-espeak; make
@end example
@item ViaVoice Outloud (AKA Eloquent). You need to purchase this engine
from the voxin.org site. That purchase will give you install-ready
packages for installing the speech engine as well as Emacspeak.
@item On the Mac, you can use the builtin Mac TTS engine  @MDash  emacspeak
comes with a speech server for that TTS  engine written in Python.
@end itemize
@item Having installed and configured the TTS engine of your choice, and
having built the associated speech server, set Emacspeak up to use that
engine by setting environment variable @code{DTK_PROGRAM}. If using Bash
as your shell, add the line
@example
export DTK_PROGRAM=<engine-name>
@end example
to your @code{.bash_profile}.
As an example, to use ESpeak, add
@example 
export DTK_PROGRAM=espeak
@end example
@item
 Run it by doing 
@itemize @bullet
@item
Add the line
@example
(load-file "<emacspeak-dir>/lisp/emacspeak-setup.el")
@end example
to the top of your .emacs file.
@end itemize
In the above, @code{<emacspeak-dir>} refers to the directory where you unpacked
the sources. 
@end  itemize

See the next section for details on building and testing the speech
server.


@node Building And Testing The Speech Server
@section Building And Testing The Speech Server
@subsection Speech Servers 

Speech servers are located in the @code{emacspeak/servers} directory.

@itemize @bullet
@item ESpeak: servers/espeak. This is a TCL script that   uses  a
library built in @code{servers/linux-espeak/}.
@item Dectalk:  @code{servers/dtk-exp}. This is a TCL script that does
not depend on any native code.
@item Outloud: @code{servers/outloud} or @code{servres/32-outloud} (for
64-bit machines). This is a TCL script that uses the library built in
@code{servers/linux-outloud}. Note that a checkout from GitHub gives you
a prebuilt library @MDash 
 however you will need to purchase  the TTS engine
from @url{http://voxin.org}.
@item Mac: @code{servers/mac}. This is a Python script that binds to the
native Mac TTS.
@end itemize 

@subsubsection Testing The Selected Server.

Once you have picked the TTS engine to use, 
run  the selected server script at a shell prompt, e.g. for the
@code{espeak} engine, do:
@example 
./servers/espeak
@end example

This will result in a TCL prompt.
Here, you can test the  TTS engine by:





@itemize @bullet
@item
@example
q "this is a test."
d
@end example

 You should hear the TTS engine  speak  the text.
@item @samp{s}
 The above command stops speech.
 You should see a TCL prompt when you execute it.
@end itemize

Quit this TCL
session by typing @kbd{C-D}.

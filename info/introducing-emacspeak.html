    <h2 class="unnumbered">This Essay</h2>

    <p>In this essay, I will recommend that you and your friend
    read parts of the Emacspeak manual together, practice commands,
    and practice using the online help. In addition, I shall talk
    about the notions behind GNU Emacs, which underlies
    Emacspeak.</p>

    <p>Your friend may be permanently blind, partially blind, or
    like a car driver, situationally blind. Regardless of
    circumstance, your friend will find that Emacspeak is different
    from other user interfaces.</p>

    <p>You will notice that I keep mentioning `your friend'; of
    course, you may be introducing yourself to Emacspeak. This is
    not impossible. It is just harder. This is how I learned
    Emacspeak.</p>

    <p>The essay has six parts. The first four parts are the core.
    The fifth and sixth parts are about particular software
    text-to-speech synthesizers and about one method of
    installation.</p>

    <ol type="1" start="1">
      <li>
        Introduction 

        <p>A short introductory segment, for orienting yourself. I
        ask two rhetorical questions.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        The advice itself 

        <p>This is the longest part.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        A short digression: free books and music 

        <p>How to download texts, such as <cite>Alice in
        Wonderland</cite>, from the Gutenberg Project.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        A sample <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
        initialization and customization file 

        <p>I cannot imagine running Emacspeak without customizing
        it.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Two software text-to-speech synthesizers 

        <p>A discussion of <code>eflite</code> and
        <code>espeakf</code>. When I first wrote this in April
        2003, I had problems with them. Now, in March 2006, they
        are good enough.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Emacspeak Installation 

        <p>This is a section on installing Emacspeak in Debian with
        both <code>eflite</code> and <code>espeakf</code>. Even
        though I am now running two instances of Emacspeak, one
        using <code>eflite</code> and the other using
        <code>espeakf</code>, I am least certain about this part.
        This is because so much of my Emacs and other installation
        is from sources rather than from standard, precompiled
        binaries. I don't know what a standard Debian or standard
        Emacspeak installation involves. I think what I describe is
        correct; but am not sure.</p>

    <h2 class="unnumbered">Questions to Help Orient Yourself</h2>

    <p>My first question is whether you already know and use
    Emacspeak and are introducing someone else to an already
    running Emacspeak with which you have experience, or whether
    you are the new user and must not only learn to use Emacspeak
    yourself, but must also install it? (I know there are other
    alternatives, but these are critical.)</p>

    <p>My hope is that you are the first: that you, the reader, are
    someone who already knows and uses Emacspeak and are
    introducing it to someone else; but my fear is that you are the
    second. The second path is harder.</p>

    <p>I will mention installation again after introducing
    Emacspeak, talking about some of the underlying notions behind
    GNU Emacs, and several other matters. But first, I would like
    to ask you what kind of text-to-speech facility you have?</p>

    <p>Are you using an external synthesizer, an internal hardware
    card for <dfn>text-to-speech</dfn> generation or do you expect
    to use a software text-to-speech package such as
    <code>eflite</code> or <code>espeakf</code>? I do not have a
    hard synthesizer, but run both those two software packages. In
    the installation section, I will talk about them.</p>

    <p>Emacspeak was originally written for an external hardware
    DecTalk synthesizer attached to a serial port. I am told that a
    hardware synthesizer is better, whether internal or external,
    and that if you can, you should use one. However, you can also
    use a software text-to-speech program.</p>

    <p>This means that you can run Emacspeak on any computer that
    has sound, as do most contemporary personal computers. You can
    try out Emacspeak without first investing in special hardware.
    However, it is also worth bearing in mind that at the time I am
    writing this, in May 2005, <code>eflite</code> and
    <code>espeakf</code> have different virtues. Neither is as good
    as it might be. For example, my installation of
    <code>espeakf</code> sometimes restarts its speaking of
    punctuation after I shift back to a buffer, but not always. On
    the other hand <code>espeakf</code> has voices, which I really
    like. All in all, the two software synthesizers are good
    enough.</p>

    <h2 class="unnumbered">How to Introduce Emacspeak</h2>

    <p>Let me hope that you, the reader, already know and use
    Emacspeak and are introducing it to someone else. You may not
    be that person, but I will write this section as if you are.
    You are introducing a friend to Emacspeak.</p>

    <p>First of all, in Info, please listen together with your
    friend to the beginnings of the Emacspeak manual. You might
    want to start with the Introduction node. It is well written.
    See <a href="emacspeak.html#Introduction">Introduction</a>. You
    can use the opportunity to introduce various Emacspeak commands
    and to discuss the philosophy or world-view behind
    Emacspeak.</p>

    <p>You can also explain the meaning of some of the jargon, such
    as `point' to mean the place in the text where commands
    operate, `visit' to mean opening a file in a buffer, and
    `string' to mean a `string of characters'.</p>

    <p>Sighted people tend to work with the three contemporary user
    interfaces: command line, graphical, and Emacs. Each is
    different.</p>

    <p>A key to Emacspeak is to understand that it provides a
    fourth type of user interface.</p>

    <p>Emacspeak is different from the shell command line interface
    that uses commands such as `ls'. It is different from a graphic
    user interface such as GNOME/sawfish that uses a package such
    as `Mozilla'. Moreover, although it is based on the virtual
    lisp machine interface that is GNU Emacs, it is different from
    it, too.</p>

    <p>Put another way, Emacs and Emacspeak are both integrated
    user interfaces, like a shell, plus `vi', plus `ls', plus
    `gdb', plus `gcc', and so on. While related to each other, they
    are also different.</p>

    <p>Emacspeak is a complete audio desktop; it is not a visual
    desktop. T. V. Raman describes it in his Emacspeak manual. See
    <a href="emacspeak.html#Top">Emacspeak</a>.</p>

    </div>

    <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Info and Help</h3>

    <p>Your friend will want to learn a great many keystroke
    commands, but if he is like me, he will continually forget
    them, too.</p>

    <p>So you need to teach him how to use Info, which is where he
    can listen to the Emacspeak manual. And you need to teach him
    how to use help. This way, he can always learn more, or relearn
    what he has forgot.</p>

    <p class="noindent">The first commands I learned were:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>Control-h Control-e</code></dt>

      <dd>
        Give a brief overview of Emacspeak. 

        <p>I use this command all the time, to remind me of other
        commands.</p>

        <p>(In most Emacs documentation, this command,
        <code>Control-h Control-e</code> is written as <code>C-h
        C-e</code>.)<br />
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>Control-e left-brace</code></dt>

      <dd>
        Speak paragraph. 

        <p>With a prefix arg, speak the rest of the current
        paragraph. With a negative prefix arg, read from the start
        of the current paragraph to the current position, that is,
        to point.<br />
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>Control-u</code></dt>

      <dd>
        The <dfn>universal-argument</dfn>. This is the prefix arg. 

        <p>Use as a prefix to some interactive commands, such as
        <kbd>Control-u&nbsp;Control-e&nbsp;left-brace</kbd> 
        <!-- /@w -->, which speaks the rest of the current
        paragraph.</p>

        <p>To read from the beginning of the current paragraph to
        point, type
        <kbd>Control-u&nbsp;hyphen&nbsp;one&nbsp;Control-e&nbsp;left-brace</kbd><!-- /@w -->.<br />
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>Control-e left-angle-bracket</code></dt>

      <dd>
        Speak a page. 

        <p>With a prefix arg, speak the rest of the current
        page.</p>

        <p>I often use the <kbd>Control-u Control-e
        left-angle-bracket</kbd> command.<br />
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>Control-e s</code></dt>

      <dd>Stop speech.<br />
      </dd>

      <dt><code>Control-h i</code></dt>

      <dd>
        Start Info. 

        <p>In Info, press <kbd>h</kbd> for an Info tutorial.<br />
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>Control-h t</code></dt>

      <dd>Start the Emacs Tutorial.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Your friend will also need to learn the regular movement and
    search keys. The Emacs Tutorial is good for this. But first
    teach him how to listen to Info and to use the online help.</p>

    <p>Note that the Emacs Tutorial contains left and right angle
    brackets in two places. To hear them in Emacspeak, you must set
    the punctuation mode to all, with the command:</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     Control-e d p all RET
</pre>

    <p class="noindent">Otherwise, the brackets will not be spoken.
    (The &lt;RET&gt; at the end of the command means to press the
    Return key after typing all.)</p>

    <p>In most Emacs documentation, a command such as Control-e
    left-brace command is written as <code>C-e {</code>. If you are
    listening in Emacspeak, you have to set the punctuation mode to
    all; otherwise, you will not hear the left-brace spoken.</p>

    </div>

    <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Movement</h3>

    <p>As for movement: incremental search is the most important
    way of moving around documents. This command is bound to
    <kbd>Control-s</kbd>, which is usually written as
    <kbd>C-s</kbd>. Often people do not think of a search command
    as a movement command, but it is.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Emacs incremental search provides the single best
    user interface for a search command that exists. Many other
    search commands require that you figure out your search string
    before you type, which means that the search fails when you
    type too little. Incremental search is nicer to use.</p>

    <p>The character and word movement keys, and the character and
    word deletion keys, are reasonably easy for English speakers to
    learn, since they use English language mnemonics:
    <kbd>Control-f</kbd> to move forward a character,
    <kbd>Meta-f</kbd> to move forward a word. (Meta-f is usually
    written as <kbd>M-f</kbd>.) p is for previous, n is for next, b
    is for backwards, and d is for delete.</p>

    <p>Control key commands are often (but not always) for
    character movement; Meta key commands are often (but not
    always) for word movement.</p>

    <div class="node">

      rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#How-to-Introduce-Emacspeak">How
      to Introduce Emacspeak</a>
    </div>

    <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Keybindings</h3>

    <p>You will want to explain the use of Meta. You might tell
    your friend that on many modern keyboards, a Meta key is what
    is now, generally and erroneously, labeled Alt, spelled
    A&nbsp;L&nbsp;T <!-- /@w -->, and usually written &lt;ALT&gt;.
    (Genuine Alt keys can and do exist; but the default keybinding
    for many machines automatically makes the key labeled Alt be a
    Meta key. Naturally, you should set up the machine so that a
    key labeled Alt takes on a Meta keybinding, for example with
    the <samp><span
    class="command">install-keymap&nbsp;emacs2</span></samp><!-- /@w -->
     command.)</p>

    <p>Worse, in some cases, people press the Escape key to
    simulate a Meta keypress. The Escape key is usually written
    &lt;ESC&gt;. No one in their right mind uses an Escape key,
    unless forced by a really old keyboard.</p>

    <p>While I am speaking of keybindings, and to be complete,
    please be sure the control key is the key to the left of the A
    key. This is something you should set up; you don't need to
    explain any of this.</p>

    <p>You may have to change the keybinding. On some keyboards,
    the key to the left of the A key is labeled Caps_Lock. It is as
    if the keyboard manufacturers think that computers are
    typewriters from 1885. Moreover, they put the key labeled
    Control in an awkward spot, and then provide default
    keybindings that match the labels. You have to change the
    keybindings.</p>

    <p>Generally, the proper keymap is in</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/emacs2.kmap.gz
<br />
<span class="roman">or</span><br />
     /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/emacs2.kmap.gz
</pre>

    <p>You can install the keymap permanently on your system for a
    console with the shell command:</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     install-keymap emacs2
</pre>

    <p class="noindent">(This may be a Debian specific command; it
    copies the <samp><span
    class="file">emacs2.kmap.gz</span></samp> file to the
    <samp><span
    class="file">/etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz</span></samp> file,
    which is loaded into the kernel at boot-time. The older and
    widely used command is <samp><span

    <p class="noindent">(Note that since files in the <samp><span

    <p>If you are using an X Windows graphical user interface, you
    may need to specify the keymap that X uses in addition to
    specifying the keymap used by a console.</p>

    <p>You can put the following commands in your

<pre class="smallexample">
     xmodmap -e "clear Lock"

    <p>Some systems reverse the meaning of the Help key, which is
    <kbd>Control-h</kbd>, and the Delete key. The node <samp><span

    <p>You can go directly to that node in Info by evaluating the

    <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Setting the Speech Rate</h3>

    <p>Returning to what you might talk about early on with your
    friend:</p>

    <p>He may want to set the voice synthesizer speech rate. I use
    both the <samp><span
    class="command">dtk-set-predefined-speech-rate</span></samp>
    command:</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     Control-e d 1
     Control-e d 2
     Control-e d 3
</pre>

    <p class="noindent">and the <samp><span
    class="command">dtk-set-rate</span></samp> command, such as</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     Control-e d r 230 RET
</pre>

    <p>Probably it is a good idea to pick one of these commands.
    Two sets of commands may overload his memory.</p>

    <p>As he gains more experience, your friend will be able to
    understand text spoken faster and faster, and will want to
    increase its speed.</p>

    <p>Note that in both set-rate commands, an interactive prefix
    means to set the speech rate globally. Otherwise, it is set
    only for the current buffer.</p>

    <p>Your friend may want to set rates globally, so it is worth
    telling him about typing <kbd>Control-u</kbd> first.</p>

<pre class="smallexample">

    <p class="noindent">(As I said earlier, you can go directly to
    that node by evaluating the Emacs Lisp expression: position
    point after the final parenthesis and type <kbd>Control-x
    Control-e</kbd>.)</p>

    <p>Perhaps evaluation is too much too soon, since it means
    remembering a new command as well as figuring out where `point'
    is. On the other hand, I think it is worth illustrating the
    action, since it opens up future possibilities.</p>

    <p>Incidentally, you can go directly to the Introduction node
    of the Emacspeak manual by evaluating:</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     (info "(emacspeak)Introduction")
</pre>

    <p>My hope is that you will inspire your friend to experiment
    with many commands and learn a few of them; you will inspire
    him to learn how to use the help features, to listen to the
    Emacspeak Info manual, and then to listen to the Emacs
    manual.</p>

    <p>After that, he can start using Emacs W3 or Emacs W3M mode to
    browse the Web, Emacs RMAIL mode to listen to Email, and Emacs

    <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Characteristics of GNU Emacs</h3>

    <p>While listening to the Emacspeak Info manual, it is worth
    explaining some of the problems people have with the Emacs
    manual, to which he should listen next, or at least listen to
    part of it. I do not recommend listening to it all at once.</p>

    <p>The Emacs manual is tightly written. When I first read it, I
    found I sometimes had to spend several minutes puzzling out a
    concise meaning. The good news is that it is accurate and well
    written. And after you understand it, the sentences make
    perfect sense.</p>

    <p>When I first started, I read the manual in segments over 2
    years. (This was in the 1980s.) I did not understand all that I
    could do at first. Indeed, for the longest time, I did not
    switch from using `ls -al' in a command line to using Dired
    mode.</p>

    <p>Some people say that the Emacs learning curve is steep.</p>

    <p>In my experience, this is not true. It took me about five
    minutes to start to use Emacs productively. But I could not and
    did not do much at first, except write.</p>

    <p>However, the learning curve will be steep if you try all at
    once to use many of the features that Emacs provides. I have
    described GNU Emacs as</p>

    <blockquote class="c1">
      <small class="dots">...</small> like having a dragon's cave
      of treasures.
    </blockquote>

    <p>You should not try to be too greedy and over-stuff yourself
    all one sitting.</p>

    <p>(That quotation is from the Info node "On Reading this Text"
    in the Info manual that introduces programming in Emacs
    Lisp:</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     (info "(eintr)On Reading this Text")
</pre>

    <p>I wrote that text "as an elementary introduction for people
    who are not programmers", but presupposed experience with
    Emacs. So I doubt you or your friend will want to look at it
    early on. But I hope that he will keep it in mind for the
    future.)</p>

    <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Peculiarities of the Emacs
    manual</h3>

    <p>To listen to the Emacs manual in Emacspeak, you will need to
    set the punctuation mode to all with the command:</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     Control-e d p all RET
</pre>

    <p>RMS, Richard M. Stallman, wrote the Emacs manual.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, RMS thinks of editing as having a very large
    meaning. He writes as if using <samp><span
    class="command">ls</span></samp> and <samp><span
    class="command">rm</span></samp> in a command line is the shell
    equivalent of editing in Emacspeak. People who use a shell do
    not think of this as editing.</p>

    <p>However, if you think about it, you will discover that the
    Emacspeak actions in Dired mode are a kind of editing. Indeed,
    the name Dired is a contraction for the phrase `directory
    editor'.</p>

    <p>But the kind of editing that goes on in Dired is not same
    kind of editing as people do in an editor like <samp><span
    class="command">vi</span></samp> when they press the
    <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, and <kbd>l</kbd> keys
    to move around. People are fooled by the language.</p>

    <p>The words <dfn>mode</dfn> and <dfn>library</dfn> are not
    confusing, but may not be understood immediately. The two
    provide the features that programs have in other interfaces.
    Thus Dired mode provides the same features in Emacs that the
    combination of <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp>,
    <samp><span class="command">mv</span></samp>, <samp><span
    class="command">chown</span></samp>, <samp><span
    class="command">chgrp</span></samp>, <samp><span
    class="command">gzip</span></samp>, <samp><span
    class="command">more</span></samp>, <samp><span
    class="command">vi</span></samp>, and <samp><span
    class="command">rm</span></samp> provide in a shell. A library
    provides a mode.</p>

    <p>Because of the adoption of Xerox Parc style windowing
    systems over the past generation, many people are confused by
    Emacs' use of the words window and frame. Emacs provides for
    multiple windows within a frame, as it always has.</p>

    <p>You will probably not use a graphic user interface at all;
    but enough people do that you will hear what they say.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, sighted people often think of a window on a
    computer screen as being a contiguous, usually rectangular
    space, what in Emacs is called a frame. That is because Emacs
    was designed initially to fill a complete display as a tiling
    window manager. (A tiling window manager is one in which
    windows do not overlap, but are contiguous, like physical
    tiles.) Parts of the display were called windows because they
    enabled a sighted person to look at all or part of a
    buffer.</p>

    <p>Companies like Apple and Sun, and the X Consortium, copied
    Emacs jargon for their own windows, to mean a part of a screen.
    (Or else the notion of a window was generic and
    commonplace.)</p>

    <p>Thus, the term window started out and continues to mean a
    part of a display.</p>

    <p>But when Apple, Sun, and the X Consortium, and their
    followers, adopted the term window to mean a part of a display,
    they lacked a term to handle a part of a window. (The word
    `pane' was suggested, but never popular, because it sounds
    similar to the word `pain', spelled p&nbsp;a&nbsp;i&nbsp;n 
    <!-- /@w -->, and because some people were accustomed to
    material windows that were not made up of multiple `panes of
    glass'.)</p>

    <p>However, in those days, mostly the 1980s, windows seldom
    contained parts, other than a menu or tool bar or panel that
    applied to a whole window. Thus, one spreadsheet would appear
    in one window; one file would appear in another.</p>

    <p>Indeed, many of the non-Emacs programs I use today in a
    graphic user interface still tend to put one set of contents,
    with its associated panels and tool bars, into one window: for
    example, XMMS, Mozilla, or <samp><span
    class="command">gnome-apt</span></samp>.</p>

    <p>With Emacs, on the other hand, you could always put a
    directory listing, two files, and an email message into four
    different parts of an Apple or X style window (although most
    people keep to one or two parts most of the time). These
    different parts had always been themselves called windows, and
    so they remained. Hence, the invention of the term frame to
    refer to a segment of a display as produced by an X or Sun user
    interface program.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, you can start different frames in an instance of
    Emacspeak that is not running in a graphical user interface.
    One frame overlies another. The mode line will tell you which
    frame you are in. (Type <kbd>Control-e m</kbd> to listen to the
    mode line. That key chord calls the <samp><span
    class="command">emacspeak-speak-mode-line</span></samp>
    command. The frame number is listed in the second and
    subsequent frames.)</p>

    <p>Emacs jargon can be brutal. Some people are upset by the use
    of the word `kill' to mean `cut' as in `cut and paste'. (The
    word `cut' also upsets some people, but generally less than the
    word `kill'.) In Emacs, an entity `killed' can be resurrected,
    which I think of as a Christian form of meaning.</p>

    <p>Some years ago, at the transition from Emacs version 18 to
    version 19, I offered to convert every use in Emacs of the word
    <code>kill</code> to <code>clip</code>. There were more than
    400 such uses. You could <code>clip</code> a segment of text,
    and if it were never put back, it would be deleted.
    Alternatively, you could yank the segment from the
    <code>clip-ring</code>. I picked <code>clip</code> as the
    replacement word since it has four letters and fits the older
    formatting and language without requiring much rewriting.</p>

    <p>Moreover, had I changed the term to `cut', people would have
    expected me to replace the word <code>yank</code> with `paste',
    to fit the phrase `cut and paste'. But I do not like the word
    `paste'; I no longer literally paste clips onto a sheet of
    paper as I did when I was young. It makes more sense to me to
    <code>yank</code> a segment back from the
    <code>clip-ring</code>.</p>

    <p>However, RMS never wanted me to make the replacement. I
    think part of the reason is that at that time, RMS still
    enjoyed what I think of as a dead joke: the manual for version
    18 Emacs said:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <small class="dots">...</small> you don't have to kill all
      the text in one command; you can keep killing line after
      line, or word after word, until you have killed it all, and
      you can still get it all back at once. (Thus we join
      television in leading people to kill thoughtlessly.)
    </blockquote>

    <p class="noindent">(The parenthetical remark about television
    was removed sometime later and the other wording slightly
    improved.)</p>

    <p>Perhaps more significantly, RMS asked many people whether
    they were bothered by the jargon use of <code>kill</code>. They
    said `no'. It turned out that RMS asked people he thought of as
    significant, namely people at M.I.T. I think that was too
    narrow a group. But that is what happened, and I still think it
    was a mistake.</p>

    <p>Most important of all, please emphasize and explain that
    Emacspeak is safer than many programs. What you write is
    automatically saved to disk. This means you can work with
    unreliable power supplies, or learn by trying out new things
    and make what otherwise would be catastrophic mistakes.</p>

    <p>You can experiment and learn.</p>

    <p>With Emacspeak, you can listen to your email, browse the

    <p>You may also want to download various books, documents, and
    audio recordings from the Gutenberg Project archive, such as
    Jane Austen's novel <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite>.</p>

    <p>You can visit the archive directory using W3 mode or W3M
    mode at</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/
</pre>

    <p>I just typed</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     Meta-x w3m-goto-url
</pre>

    <p class="noindent">and then the URL to reach that directory.
    (Well, actually, I typed</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     Meta-x w3m-got
</pre>

    <p class="noindent">and then pressed return. Emacs
    automatically completed the name of the command, so I did not
    have to do so much typing. And I copied the long URL listed
    above into the minibuffer so I did not have to type it. I hate
    typing and avoid it as much as possible.)</p>

    <p>The index is</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     GUTINDEX.ALL
</pre>

    <p class="noindent">and you can download it using W3M mode by
    positioning point on the name and pressing the return key.
    (There are other ways of downloading it, too; this is one of
    them.)</p>

    <p>As I write this in March 2006, the Gutenberg Project index
    is 2 megabytes long and lists more than ten thousand books,
    documents, and audio recordings. I saved my copy to a file,
    since I dislike long downloads.</p>

    <p>You may want to use Emacspeak to listen to <cite>Pride and
    Prejudice</cite>, <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite>, <cite>The
    Federalist Papers</cite> or other of the Gutenberg books,
    documents, and music.</p>

    <p>The text files from the Gutenberg Project that I have
    downloaded use the DOS `<samp><span
    class="samp">carriage-return linefeed</span></samp>' convention
    to mark ends of lines rather than the Unix `<samp><span
    class="samp">newline</span></samp>' convention. This does not
    really matter since Emacspeak automatically detects the
    convention and visits the file using the DOS end-of-line coding
    format.</p>

    <p>However, I prefer the Unix end-of-line format. After
    visiting a file, I run the <samp><span
    class="command">set-buffer-file-coding-system</span></samp>
    command on it:</p>
<pre class="smallexample">

    Emacspeak. As far as I can figure, the only person who likes

    customizations that I like.</p>

    <p>The following <samp><span

    <p class="noindent">In the <samp><span

    <h2 class="unnumbered">Two Software text-to-speech
    Synthesizers</h2>

    <p>At the time I write this in May 2005, I am running two
    instances of Emacspeak, one using the <code>eflite</code>
    software text-to-speech synthesizer and the other using the
    <code>espeakf</code> software text-to-speech synthesizer.</p>

    <p>The current <code>espeakf</code> provides different voices,
    which my current version of <code>eflite</code> lacks. Also, in
    my set up, it sometimes speaks pronunciation when it should
    not; but not always.</p>

    <p>I prefer <code>espeakf</code>.</p>

    <p>At the moment, I am using two different Emacspeak commands,
    one for starting Emacspeak with <code>eflite</code> and the
    other for starting Emacspeak with <code>espeakf</code>. Right
    now, I am running both, each as its own instance of
    Emacspeak.</p>

    <p>The two starting commands are:</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     emacspeak-eflite
     
     emacspeak-espeak
</pre>

    <p class="noindent">The two commands are shell scripts in the
    /usr/local/bin/ directory.</p>

    <p>The regular Emacspeak command is in the /usr/bin/ directory,
    but since these two commands are experimental, I am putting
    them into the /usr/local/bin/ directory, to remind me that I
    created them locally.</p>

    <p>(Incidentally, I am also running two other non-Emacspeak
    instances of Emacs: an experimental Emacs version 22 owned by
    user `bob', and an Emacs version 20.7 owned by user `root'.
    That way, I separate dangerous system administration task from
    ordinary work.)</p>

    <h2 class="unnumbered">Installation: Debian and
    <code>espeakf</code></h2>

    <p>Regarding installation: if you have not installed Emacspeak
    recently, and plan to install the package again soon for
    someone else, please practice a reinstall first. Perhaps,
    nowadays, all will go well; but perhaps not.</p>

    <p>In the past, I have had troubles with Emacspeak
    installation, although in 2003 and more recently, everything
    has gone well. I am sighted, and do not depend on Emacspeak, so
    perhaps I continually renew my ignorance.</p>

    <p>In addition to a computer with a sound system, Emacspeak
    requires three packages:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>GNU Emacs,</li>

      <li>Emacspeak, and</li>

      <li>a text-to-speech synthesizer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A hardware text-to-speech synthesizer is best, but I do not
    have one. Instead I use two different software text-to-speech
    synthesizers, both of which are immature programs that make use
    of the more basic Festival text-to-speech program.</p>

    <p>Installation is extensively described in the Emacspeak
    manual. See <a
    href="emacspeak.html#Installation">Installation</a>.</p>

    <p>Also, James R. Van Zandt has written an installation HOWTO
    that is now maintained by Sharon Snider. It is in the Emacspeak
    sources and on the Web at <a
    href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Emacspeak-HOWTO/">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Emacspeak-HOWTO/</a>.</p>

    <p>Please consider building and installing your software from
    source. This process is straightforward and I have done this in
    the past with great success.</p>

    <p>However, I am going to describe only what you do to install
    <code>espeakf</code>, which is not in Debian, and what you do
    in Debian to install <code>eflite</code>. The process should be
    simple, but for some reason, possibly because I tend to use
    unstable, experimental software, I have not always found it
    so.</p>

    <p>In Debian, as of April 2003, to install Emacspeak using the
    eflite software text-to-speech synthesizer, type the following
    in a shell:</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     apt-get install emacs21 emacs21-el emacspeak eflite
</pre>

    <p>The <samp><span class="file">emacs21-el</span></samp>
    package contains the Emacs Lisp source files that Emacs uses.
    In theory, you can run Emacs without them, but I have found
    them essential, if only for the extra documentation and
    commentary they provide. It does not matter if some of the
    packages are already installed or will be installed
    automatically.</p>

    <p>After running <samp><span
    class="command">apt-get</span></samp>, you should be able to
    run Emacspeak by typing</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     emacspeak
</pre>

    <p class="noindent">in a shell. That command is a shell script
    in <samp><span
    class="file">/usr/bin/emacspeak</span></samp>.</p>

    <p>In theory, that is all there is to it. And if you are not
    using the awkward, non-standard system that I am, but instead
    are using a well configured, modern, standard system, what I
    just told you should work.</p>

    <p>Since I run both the <code>eflite</code> and
    <code>espeakf</code> text-to-speech synthesizers, and at this
    stage am running them in what amounts to a local experiment, I
    copied the shell script that starts Emacspeak with eflite from
    the /usr/bin/ directory to the /usr/local/bin/ directory and
    renamed it to <samp><span
    class="file">/usr/local/bin/emacspeak-eflite</span></samp>.</p>

    <p>I start Emacspeak with <code>espeakf</code> with a different
    shell script, called <samp><span
    class="file">/usr/local/bin/emacspeak-epeakf</span></samp>.
    (These names are not very imaginative, but I can remember
    them.)</p>

    <p><code>espeakf</code> is available from CVS on SourceForge.
    Fortunately, it is easy to download and install.</p>

    <p>First you need to decide on a directory in which you plan to
    keep the <code>espeakf</code> directory that you will download.
    I use</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     /usr/local/src/
</pre>

    <p>Make that directory if you do not have it already, then go
    to it.</p>

    <p>Here are the commands, which I run as the non-privileged
    user `<samp><span class="samp">bob</span></samp>' in a shell,
    such as one in Emacspeak that you can start with the
    <kbd>Meta-x term</kbd> command.</p>

    <p>This facility is described in</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     (info "(emacspeak)Running Terminal Based Applications")
</pre>

    <p class="noindent">(Before you try <kbd>Meta-x term</kbd>, be
    sure to learn how to get out of the buffer! In Term mode, the
    usual commands for killing a buffer or switching buffers do not
    work. I find <kbd>Control-c Control-f</kbd>, the new keybinding
    for <code>find-file</code> useful, as well as <kbd>Control-c
    k</kbd>, which kills the buffer.)</p>

    <p>In a shell, I first switch to the appropriate directory, and
    then I run the CVS login command:</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     cd /usr/local/src/
     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.espeakf.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/espeakf login
</pre>

    <p>You need to login once for CVS. The login command will ask
    for your password. Just press your return key. Then, type the
    following command:</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.espeakf.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/espeakf co espeakf
</pre>

    <p>These commands will create a <samp><span
    class="file">/usr/local/src/espeakf/</span></samp> directory
    below your <samp><span
    class="file">/usr/local/src/</span></samp> directory and fill
    it with several files and other directories. To make use of the
    <code>espeakf</code> text-to-speech synthesizer, Emacspeak runs
    an executable Perl script called <code>espeakf.pl</code>. CVS
    installs that Perl script properly, so you do not need to do
    anything.</p>

    <p>However, you do need to modify your <samp><span
    class="file">/usr/local/bin/emacspeak-eflite</span></samp> and
    <samp><span
    class="file">/usr/local/bin/emacspeak-espeakf</span></samp>
    start up scripts for the two different text-to-speech
    synthesizers.</p>

    <p>I use a variation on the <code>/usr/bin/emacspeak</code>
    script that Emacspeak creates automatically. That script uses
    information from a <samp><span
    class="file">/etc/emacspeak.conf</span></samp> file. I ignore
    that configuration file because the configuration for Emacspeak
    with the two synthesizers is different. Instead, I put all the
    configuration information into the two <samp><span
    class="file">/usr/local/bin/</span></samp> scripts.</p>

    <p>The two scripts contain sharp signs, exclamation marks, left
    and right brackets, and much else. To listen to all the
    characters in them, you need to set Emacspeak's punctuation
    mode to all. If you are listening to this in Emacspeak, you can
    evaluate the following expression by placing point after it and
    typing <kbd>Control-x Control-e</kbd>:</p>
<pre class="smallexample">
     (dtk-set-punctuations 'all)
</pre>

    <p class="noindent">First, the <samp><span
    class="file">/usr/local/bin/emacspeak-eflite</span></samp>
    script.</p>

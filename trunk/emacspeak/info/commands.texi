Commentary:
Defines the TTS interface.


Automatically generated documentation
for commands defined in module  dtk-speak.



@unnumberedsec dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space
@findex dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space
@kindex  control e d SPACE 
@kbd { control e d SPACE }

Toggle splitting of speech on white space.
This affects the internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split
text purely by clause boundaries, or also include
whitespace.  By default, emacspeak sends a clause at a time
to the speech device.  This produces fluent speech for
normal use.  However in modes such as `shell-mode' and some
programming language modes, clause markers appear
infrequently, and this can result in large amounts of text
being sent to the speech device at once, making the system
unresponsive when asked to stop talking.  Splitting on white
space makes emacspeak's stop command responsive.  However,
when splitting on white space, the speech sounds choppy
since the synthesizer is getting a word at a time.



@unnumberedsec dtk-set-chunk-separator-syntax
@findex dtk-set-chunk-separator-syntax
@kindex  control e d RETURN 
@kbd { control e d RETURN }

Interactively set how text is split in chunks.
See the Emacs documentation on syntax tables for details on how characters are
classified into various syntactic classes.
Argument S specifies the syntax class.



@unnumberedsec tts-restart
@findex tts-restart
@kindex  control e control s 
@kbd { control e control s }

Use this to nuke the currently running TTS server and restart it.



@unnumberedsec dtk-select-server
@findex dtk-select-server
@kindex  control e d d 
@kbd { control e d d }

Select a speech server interactively.
Argument PROGRAM specifies the speech server program.
When called  interactively, The selected server is started immediately. 



@unnumberedsec dtk-toggle-debug
@findex dtk-toggle-debug
@kindex  control e d b 
@kbd { control e d b }

Toggle state of the debug FLAG.
When debugging is on, you can switch to the buffer
*speaker* to examine the output from the process
that talks to the speech device by using command C-e d M-C-b.
Note: *speaker* is a hidden buffer, ie it has a leading space in its name.



@unnumberedsec tts-show-debug-buffer
@findex tts-show-debug-buffer
@kindex  control e d meta control b 
@kbd { control e d meta control b }

Select TTS debugging buffer.

@node dtk-tcl, emacspeak-aumix, dtk-speak, Emacspeak Commands

Commentary:
Interface to speech server.


Automatically generated documentation
for commands defined in module  dtk-tcl.



@unnumberedsec dtk-set-predefined-speech-rate
@findex dtk-set-predefined-speech-rate
@kindex  control e d 9   control e d 8   control e d 7   control e d 6   control e d 5   control e d 4   control e d 3   control e d 2   control e d 1   control e d 0 
@kbd { control e d 9   control e d 8   control e d 7   control e d 6   control e d 5   control e d 4   control e d 3   control e d 2   control e d 1   control e d 0 }

Set speech rate to one of nine predefined levels.
Interactive PREFIX arg says to set the rate globally.



@unnumberedsec dtk-reset-state
@findex dtk-reset-state
@kindex  control e d  cap R  
@kbd { control e d  cap R  }

Restore sanity to the Dectalk.
Typically used after the Dectalk has been power   cycled.



@unnumberedsec dtk-resume
@findex dtk-resume
@kindex  control e SPACE 
@kbd { control e SPACE }

Resume paused speech.
This command resumes  speech that has been suspended by executing
command `dtk-pause' bound to C-e p.
If speech has not been paused,
and variable `dtk-resume-should-toggle' is t
 then this command will pause ongoing speech.



@unnumberedsec dtk-set-punctuations-to-some
@findex dtk-set-punctuations-to-some
 No global keybinding

Set punctuation  mode to some.
Interactive PREFIX arg sets punctuation mode globally.



@unnumberedsec dtk-toggle-split-caps
@findex dtk-toggle-split-caps
@kindex  control e d s 
@kbd { control e d s }

Toggle split caps mode.
Split caps mode is useful when reading
Hungarian notation in program source code.  Interactive PREFIX arg
means toggle the global default value, and then set the current local
value to the result.



@unnumberedsec dtk-add-cleanup-pattern
@findex dtk-add-cleanup-pattern
@kindex  control e d a 
@kbd { control e d a }

Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that
are cleaned up.  Optional interactive prefix arg deletes
this pattern if previously added.  Cleaning up repeated
patterns results in emacspeak speaking the pattern followed
by a repeat count instead of speaking all the characters
making up the pattern.  Thus, by adding the repeating
pattern `.' (this is already added by default) emacspeak
will say ``aw fifteen dot'' when speaking the string
``...............'' instead of ``period period period period
''



@unnumberedsec dtk-set-rate
@findex dtk-set-rate
@kindex  control e d r 
@kbd { control e d r }

Set speaking RATE for the tts.
Interactive PREFIX arg means set   the global default value, and then set the
current local  value to the result.

This function is advised.

Before-advice `emacspeak-auto':
Automatically defined advice to speak interactive prompts. 



@unnumberedsec dtk-set-punctuations-to-all
@findex dtk-set-punctuations-to-all
 No global keybinding

Set punctuation  mode to all.
Interactive PREFIX arg sets punctuation mode globally.



@unnumberedsec dtk-set-punctuations
@findex dtk-set-punctuations
@kindex  control e d p 
@kbd { control e d p }

Set punctuation mode to MODE.
Possible values are `some', `all', or `none'.
Interactive PREFIX arg means set   the global default value, and then set the
current local  value to the result.



@unnumberedsec dtk-pause
@findex dtk-pause
@kindex  control e p 
@kbd { control e p }

Pause ongoing speech.
The speech can be resumed with command `dtk-resume'
normally bound to C-e SPC.  Pausing speech is useful when one needs to
perform a few actions before continuing to read a large document.  Emacspeak
gives you speech feedback as usual once speech has been paused.  `dtk-resume'
continues the interrupted speech irrespective of the buffer
in which it is executed.
Optional PREFIX arg flushes any previously paused speech.



@unnumberedsec dtk-set-pronunciation-mode
@findex dtk-set-pronunciation-mode
@kindex  control e d m 
@kbd { control e d m }

Set pronunciation MODE.
This command is valid only for newer
Dectalks, e.g.  the Dectalk Express.  Possible values are `math, name,
europe, spell', all of which can be turned on or off.
Argument STATE specifies new state.



@unnumberedsec dtk-toggle-quiet
@findex dtk-toggle-quiet
@kindex  control e d q 
@kbd { control e d q }

Toggle state of the speech device between being quiet and talkative.
Useful if you want to continue using an Emacs session that has
emacspeak loaded but wish to make the speech shut up.
Optional argument PREFIX specifies whether speech is turned off in the current buffer o rin all buffers.



@unnumberedsec dtk-toggle-stop-immediately-while-typing
@findex dtk-toggle-stop-immediately-while-typing
@kindex  control e d  cap I  
@kbd { control e d  cap I  }

Toggle state of variable `dtk-stop-immediately-while-typing'.
As the name implies, if T then speech flushes immediately as you
type.
Optional argument PREFIX specifies if the setting applies to all buffers.



@unnumberedsec dtk-toggle-capitalization
@findex dtk-toggle-capitalization
@kindex  control e d c 
@kbd { control e d c }

Toggle capitalization.
when set, capitalization is indicated by a
short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
value, and then set the current local value to the result.



@unnumberedsec dtk-stop
@findex dtk-stop
@kindex  pause   control e s   ESCAPE [  cap P  
@kbd { pause   control e s   ESCAPE [  cap P  }

Stop speech now.



@unnumberedsec dtk-set-character-scale
@findex dtk-set-character-scale
@kindex  control e d f 
@kbd { control e d f }

Set scale FACTOR for   speech rate.
Speech rate is scaled by this factor
when speaking characters.
Interactive PREFIX arg means set   the global default value, and then set the
current local  value to the result.

This function is advised.

Automatically defined advice to speak interactive prompts. 



@unnumberedsec dtk-toggle-allcaps-beep
@findex dtk-toggle-allcaps-beep
@kindex  control e d  cap C  
@kbd { control e d  cap C  }

Toggle allcaps-beep.
when set, allcaps words  are  indicated by a
short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
value, and then set the current local value to the result.
Note that allcaps-beep is a very useful thing when programming.
However it is irritating to have it on when reading documents.



@unnumberedsec dtk-toggle-punctuation-mode
@findex dtk-toggle-punctuation-mode
@kindex  delete 
@kbd { delete }

Toggle punctuation mode between "some" and "all".
Interactive PREFIX arg makes the new setting global.

Flexible hide and show for emacspeak.
This module allows one to easily hide or expose
blocks of lines starting with a common prefix.
It is motivated by the need to flexibly hide quoted text in email

 An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

Pre-requisites:

1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

2) An OCR engine.

1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have
the utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a
tiff file.  Then set variable
emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at this utility.
By default, this is set to `scanimage' which is the image
scanning utility provided by SANE.

By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired
tiff image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.
Variable emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to `tiffcp' by
default; if you use something else, you should customize
this variable.

2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and
working.  By default this front-end assumes that OCR is
available as /usr/bin/ocr.

Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying
OCR to it work independently of Emacs, you can use this
Emacspeak front-end to enable easy OCR access from within
Emacspeak.

The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command
emacspeak-ocr bound to C-e C-o.  

This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR
commands bounds to single keystrokes-- see the ke-binding
list at the end of this description.  Use Emacs online help
facility to look up help on these commands.

emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to
scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned
images and the resulting text are saved under directory
~/ocr; see variable emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.
Invoking command emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound
to M-x emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory will open this directory.

By default, the document being scanned is named `untitled'.
You can name the document by using command
emacspeak-ocr-name-document bound to
M-x emacspeak-ocr-name-document.  The document name is used
in constructing the name of the image and text files.

Here is a list of all emacspeak OCR commands along with their key-bindings:

Commentary:
This module implements user customizable pronunciation dictionaries
for emacspeak. Custom pronunciations can be defined per file, per
directory and/or per major mode. Emacspeak maintains a persistent
user dictionary upon request and loads these in new emacspeak
sessions. This module implements the user interface to the custom
dictionary as well as providing the internal API used by the rest
of emacspeak in using the dictionary.
Algorithm:

The persistent dictionary is a hash table where the hash keys are
filenames, directory names, or major-mode names. The hash values
are association lists defining the dictionary. Users of this module
can retrieve a dictionary made up of all applicable association
lists for a given file.

@unnumberedsec emacspeak-pronounce-toggle-use-of-dictionaries
@findex emacspeak-pronounce-toggle-use-of-dictionaries
 No global keybinding

Toggle use of pronunciation dictionaries in current buffer.
Pronunciations can be dfined on a per file, per directory and/or per
mode basis.
Pronunciations are activated on a per buffer basis.
Turning on the use of pronunciation dictionaries results in emacspeak
composing a pronunciation table based on the currently defined
pronunciation dictionaries.
After this, the pronunciations will be applied whenever text in the
buffer is spoken.
Optional argument state can be used from Lisp programs to
explicitly turn pronunciations on or off.

Start or control streaming audio including MP3 and
realaudio.  If using `TRPlayer' as the player, accepts
trplayer control commands if a stream is already playing.
Otherwise, the playing stream is simply stopped.  If no
stream is playing, this command prompts for a realaudio
resource.  Realaudio resources can be specified either as a
Realaudio URL, the location of a local Realaudio file, or as
the name of a local Realaudio metafile. Realaudio resources
you have played in this session are available in the
minibuffer history.  The default is to play the resource you
played most recently. Emacspeak uses the contents of the
directory specified by variable
emacspeak-realaudio-shortcuts-directory to offer a set of
completions. Hit space to use this completion list.

If using TRPlayer, you can either give one-shot commands
using command emacspeak-realaudio available from anywhere on
the audio desktop as C-e ;.
Alternatively,  switch to buffer *realaudo* if you
wish to issue many nvigation commands.  Note that buffer
*realaudio* uses a special major mode that provides the
various navigation commands via single keystrokes.

Commentary:
This module provides the interface for generating auditory icons in emacspeak.
Design goal:
1) Auditory icons should be used to provide additional feedback,
not as a gimmick.
2) The interface should be usable at all times without the icons:
e.g. when on a machine without a sound card.
3) General principle for when to use an icon:
Convey information about events taking place in parallel.
For instance, if making a selection automatically moves the current focus
to the next choice,
We speak the next choice, while indicating the fact that something was selected with a sound cue.
 This interface will assume the availability of a shell command "play"
that can take one or more sound files and play them.
This module will also provide a mapping between names in the elisp world and actual sound files.
Modules that wish to use auditory icons should use these names, instead of actual file names.
As of Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a themes
architecture for  auditory icons.
Sound files corresponding to a given theme are found in
appropriate subdirectories of emacspeak-sounds-directory

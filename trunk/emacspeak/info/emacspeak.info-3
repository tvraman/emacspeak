Emacspeak Commands
******************

dtk-add-cleanup-pattern
=======================

   control e d a

   Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that are cleaned
up.  Optional interactive prefix arg deletes this pattern if previously
added.  Cleaning up repeated patterns results in emacspeak speaking the
pattern followed by a repeat count instead of speaking all the
characters making up the pattern.  Thus, by adding the repeating
pattern `.' (this is already added by default) emacspeak will say "aw
fifteen dot" when speaking the string "..............." instead of
"period period period period "

dtk-notes-shutdown
==================

   No global keybinding

   Shutdown midi system.

dtk-pause
=========

   control e p

   Pause ongoing speech.  The speech can be resumed with command
`dtk-resume' normally bound to C-e SPC.  Pausing speech is useful when
one needs to perform a few actions before continuing to read a large
document.  Emacspeak gives you speech feedback as usual once speech has
been paused.  `dtk-resume' continues the interrupted speech
irrespective of the buffer in which it is executed.  Optional PREFIX
arg flushes any previously paused speech.

dtk-reset-state
===============

   control e d  cap R

   Restore sanity to the Dectalk.  Typically used after the Dectalk has
been power   cycled.

dtk-resume
==========

   control e SPACE

   Resume paused speech.  This command resumes  speech that has been
suspended by executing command `dtk-pause' bound to C-e p.  If speech
has not been paused, and variable `dtk-resume-should-toggle' is t  then
this command will pause ongoing speech.

dtk-select-server
=================

   control e d d

   Select a speech server interactively.  Argument PROGRAM specifies
the speech server program.  When called  interactively, The selected
server is started immediately.

dtk-set-character-scale
=======================

   control e d f

   Set scale FACTOR for   speech rate.  Speech rate is scaled by this
factor when speaking characters.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set
the global default value, and then set the current local  value to the
result.

   This function is advised.

   Before-advice `emacspeak-auto': Automatically defined advice to
speak interactive prompts.

dtk-set-chunk-separator-syntax
==============================

   control e d RETURN

   Interactively set how text is split in chunks.  See the Emacs
documentation on syntax tables for details on how characters are
classified into various syntactic classes.  Argument S specifies the
syntax class.

dtk-set-predefined-speech-rate
==============================

   control e d 9   control e d 8   control e d 7   control e d 6
control e d 5   control e d 4   control e d 3   control e d 2   control
e d 1   control e d 0

   Set speech rate to one of nine predefined levels.  Interactive
PREFIX arg says to set the rate globally.

dtk-set-pronunciation-mode
==========================

   control e d m

   Set pronunciation MODE.  This command is valid only for newer
Dectalks, e.g.  the Dectalk Express.  Possible values are `math, name,
europe, spell', all of which can be turned on or off.  Argument STATE
specifies new state.

dtk-set-punctuations
====================

   control e d p

   Set punctuation mode to MODE.  Possible values are `some', `all', or
`none'.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set   the global default value,
and then set the current local  value to the result.

dtk-set-punctuations-to-all
===========================

   No global keybinding

   Set punctuation  mode to all.  Interactive PREFIX arg sets
punctuation mode globally.

   Set speaking RATE for the tts.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set
the global default value, and then set the current local  value to the
result.

   This function is advised.

   Before-advice `emacspeak-auto': Automatically defined advice to
speak interactive prompts.

dtk-stop
========

   pause   control e s   ESCAPE [  cap P

   Stop speech now.

dtk-toggle-allcaps-beep
=======================

   control e d  cap C

   Toggle allcaps-beep.  when set, allcaps words  are  indicated by a
short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
value, and then set the current local value to the result.  Note that
allcaps-beep is a very useful thing when programming.  However it is
irritating to have it on when reading documents.

dtk-toggle-capitalization
=========================

   control e d c

   Toggle capitalization.  when set, capitalization is indicated by a
short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
value, and then set the current local value to the result.

dtk-toggle-debug
================

   control e d b

   Toggle state of the debug FLAG.  When debugging is on, you can
switch to the buffer *speaker* to examine the output from the process
that talks to the speech device by using command C-e d M-C-b.  Note:
*speaker* is a hidden buffer, ie it has a leading space in its name.

dtk-toggle-punctuation-mode
===========================

   delete

   Toggle punctuation mode between "some" and "all".  Interactive
PREFIX arg makes the new setting global.

dtk-toggle-quiet
================

   control e d q

   Toggle state of the speech device between being quiet and talkative.
Useful if you want to continue using an Emacs session that has
emacspeak loaded but wish to make the speech shut up.  Optional
argument PREFIX specifies whether speech is turned off in the current
buffer o rin all buffers.

dtk-toggle-split-caps
=====================

   control e d s

   Toggle split caps mode.  Split caps mode is useful when reading
Hungarian notation in program source code.  Interactive PREFIX arg
means toggle the global default value, and then set the current local
value to the result.

dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space
===================================

   control e d SPACE

   Toggle splitting of speech on white space.  This affects the
internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split text purely by
clause boundaries, or also include whitespace.  By default, emacspeak
sends a clause at a time to the speech device.  This produces fluent
speech for normal use.  However in modes such as `shell-mode' and some
programming language modes, clause markers appear infrequently, and
this can result in large amounts of text being sent to the speech
device at once, making the system unresponsive when asked to stop
talking.  Splitting on white space makes emacspeak's stop command
responsive.  However, when splitting on white space, the speech sounds
choppy since the synthesizer is getting a word at a time.

dtk-toggle-stop-immediately-while-typing
========================================

   control e d  cap I

   Toggle state of variable `dtk-stop-immediately-while-typing'.  As
the name implies, if T then speech flushes immediately as you type.
Optional argument PREFIX specifies if the setting applies to all
buffers.

emacspeak-ocr-mode
==================

   No global keybinding

   An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

   Pre-requisites:

   1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

   2) An OCR engine.

   1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have the
utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a tiff file.  Then
set variable emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at this utility.
By default, this is set to `scanimage' which is the image scanning
utility provided by SANE.

   By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired tiff
image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.  Variable
emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to `tiffcp' by default; if you use
something else, you should customize this variable.

   2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and working.  By
default this front-end assumes that OCR is available as /usr/bin/ocr.

   Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying OCR to it
work independently of Emacs, you can use this Emacspeak front-end to
enable easy OCR access from within Emacspeak.

   The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command emacspeak-ocr
bound to C-e C-o.

   This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR commands
bounds to single keystrokes- see the ke-binding list at the end of this
description.  Use Emacs online help facility to look up help on these
commands.

   emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to scan,
OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned images and the
resulting text are saved under directory ~/ocr; see variable
emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.  Invoking command
emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound to M-x
emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory will open this directory.

   By default, the document being scanned is named `untitled'.  You can
name the document by using command emacspeak-ocr-name-document bound to
M-x emacspeak-ocr-name-document.  The document name is used in
constructing the name of the image and text files.

   Here is a list of all emacspeak OCR commands along with their
key-bindings:

using `TRPlayer' as the player, accepts trplayer control commands if a
stream is already playing.  Otherwise, the playing stream is simply
stopped.  If no stream is playing, this command prompts for a realaudio
resource.  Realaudio resources can be specified either as a Realaudio
URL, the location of a local Realaudio file, or as the name of a local
Realaudio metafile. Realaudio resources you have played in this session
are available in the minibuffer history.  The default is to play the

allows you to display the same buffer in multiple windows or frames.
These different windows can display different portions of the buffer.
This is equivalent to leaving a book open at places at once.  This
command allows you to move to the places where you have left the book
open.  The number used to invoke this command specifies which of the
displays you wish to select.  Typically you will have two or at most
three such displays open.  The current display is 0, the next is 1, and
so on.  Optional argument ARG specifies the display to select.

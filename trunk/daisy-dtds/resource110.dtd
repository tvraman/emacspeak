<!ELEMENT head (meta*)>

<!-- Resource element contains information about the alternative representations 
of an element present in the NCX or the textual content file. An alternative 
representation can be used to convey navigational information, e.g., provide 
a descriptive name for the kind of segment (part, chapter, section, etc.) 
the user is encountering.  In addition, it can supply accessible versions of dtbook element names and names of skippable structures listed in the head of the NCX.  Text can be used for screen or Braille display, 
audio for digital talking book players, and image for screen display.
Attribute use:
type - Specifies whether the resource applies to the textual content file (dtbook) or the NCX 
(ncx). 
elementRef - Specifies the name of the element for which the resource is to be supplied.      classRef - Specifies the class attribute value of the element for which the resource is to be supplied. 
idRef - Specifies the name of the id attribute on the smilCustomTest element in NCX for which the resource is to be supplied. 
lang - Specifies the language of the resource item, using an RFC 1766 language code.

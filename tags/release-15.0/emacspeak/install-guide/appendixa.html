>	In the original Emacspeak HOWTO, James Van Zandt provided
	instructions on how to install Linux from a DOS machine using
	a null-modem cable. As with the other instructions in this
	HOWTO, I tried, unfortunately without success, to duplicate this procedure. However, I have provided the information
	gathered during testing in the following section.  If you
	successfully install Linux from a Windows&#8482; or DOS&#8482;	machine over a null-modem cable,
	please let me know the procedure you followed and I'll include
	it here.
	</P
><P
>	Please note that the original instructions for
	installing Linux over a null modem cable were written for a
	DOS machine.  I first attempted to reproduce these
	instructions with my Windows 2000 machine (from the DOS prompt) and Red Hat
	7.1.  Although I successfully downloaded and installed
	JAWS for DOS (available from Freedom Scientific at <A
HREF="http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_downloads/morejaws.asp"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_downloads/morejaws.asp</A
>),
	I was unable to get a DOS VT100 terminal emulator installed. I
	tried using TELIX, which was popular several years ago, but
	when I tried to install TELIX version 3.51, I got a runtime
	error. Since I was
	unable to find any other DOS terminal emulators, I decided to
	try using a Windows screenreader and terminal emulator
	instead. This section documents the procedure I tried with the
	Windows machine.

>	For this process, you will need a machine with a working
	speech synthesizer and a terminal emulator program. For my
	test, I used a Windows 2000 machine and tried both Narrarator
	(which comes with Windows 2000) and JAWS for Windows
	v.3.5. For the terminal emulator, I used tried both
	Hyperterminal (which comes with Windows) and CRT (which
	can be downloaded from <A
HREF="http://www.vandyke.com/products/crt"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.vandyke.com/products/crt</A
>). You will also
	need a second machine (on which to install Linux), a null
	modem cable, and a copy of your preferred Linux distribution
	on either floppy disk or CD-ROM.

>	To connect the two computers, you need a "null modem"
	cable.  A "null modem" cable is a serial cable that connects ground to ground
	and transmits on each end to receive on the other.  The cable
	that comes with the DOS application
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>LapLink</SPAN
> will work fine.  The
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>LapLink</SPAN
> cable is particularly handy
	because it has both a 9 pin and a 25 pin connector on each
	end.  Alternatively, you may be able to find a null modem
	cable at your local computer store, or you can have one made.
	If you choose to have one made, here are the required connections:

><P
>			For two 25 pin connectors, connect pin 2

			pin 5 (signal ground) to pin 7 (signal
			ground).
			</P
></LI

>	Once you have your null modem cable, you'll need to connect
	the two machines while both of them are off. It's
	easiest to use COM1 on both machines. Once you've got them
	connected, you're ready to start them up, as discussed in the
	next section

><P
>	Once your machines are connected via the null modem cable, boot the DOS/Windows
	machine, then start the terminal emulation program.  For my
	test, I tried both Hyperterminal (which comes with Windows 2000) and CRT (which
	can be downloaded from <A
HREF="http://www.vandyke.com/products/crt"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.vandyke.com/products/crt</A
>.
	For some reason, the arrow keys did not work in HyperTerminal,
	making navigation within the HyperTerminal window
	impossible. However, the arrow keys (as well as Tab and
	Return) do work in CRT, so I recommend using CRT as your
	terminal emulator.
	</P
><P
>	Set the terminal emulator 
	for 9600 baud, no parity, eight data bits, 1 stop bit. If
	"Flow control" is an option, select Hardware.  Also be sure to
	set your terminal emulation mode to VT100. Start the terminal emulator
	connection (you won't get any data at this point, as your
	Linux machine should still be off).
	</P
><P
>	Once you've set up the terminal emulator on your
	DOS/Windows machine, insert the "boot" floppy or CD into
	your Linux machine and boot the machine. With Red Hat, at
	the <TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>boot:</TT
> prompt, I typed in the
	command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>linux text console=ttyS0</B
>.  Note
	that the "s" in "ttyS0" is capitalized, and that's a "zero" at the end of
	the string, not a capital letter "o." Other distributions may
	require other strings, so if you know the syntax required for
	distros other than Red Hat,
	please let me know and I will include that information here. 
	</P
><P
>	Once you've typed in this string at the <TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>boot:</TT
>
	prompt and hit <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Return</B
>, you should get output in your terminal emulator
	program on your DOS/Windows machine.  Unfortunately, at
	this point I discovered that neither JAWS for Windows
	nor Narrarator produces speech output in either the HyperTerminal or
	CRT terminal windows. This ultimately stymied my attempts to
	install Linux over a null modem cable.

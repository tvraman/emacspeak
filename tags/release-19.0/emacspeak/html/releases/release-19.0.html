      Emacspeak Inc <a href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net">(NASDOG: ESPK)</a> announces  the immediate
      world-wide availability of Emacspeak 19.0 --a powerful audio
      desktop for leveraging today's evolving semantic WWW.
    </p>
    <h2>Investors Note</h2>
    <p>
      With several prominent analysts  initiating coverage,
      NASDOG: ESPK is now trading over the net at levels close to that
      attained recently by last year's DogCom high-fliers.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>What Is It?</h2>
    <p>
      Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides <em>
      complete eyes-free</em> access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
      environments. By seamlessly blending all aspects of the Internet
      such as Web-surfing and electronic messaging into the audio
      desktop, Emacspeak enables speech access to local and remote
      information with a consistent and well-integrated user
      interface.  A rich suite of task-oriented 
      tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to the
      evolving semantic WWW.  
    </p>
    <h2>Major Enhancements</h2>
    
    <ol>
<li>   Provides template-based pronunciation entries.</li>
<li>   Speech-enables nxml-mode ---a powerful XML environment.</li>
<li>   etc/ocr-client.pl provides support for ocrxtr from Vividata.</li>
<li>   Updated EPeriodic support.</li>
<li>   New productivity wizards.</li>
<li>   Additional websearch utilities.</li>
<li>   New smart URLs for task-oriented Web access.</li>

<li>  Speech-enables package sigbegone.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>See the NEWS file  for additional details. </p>
    
    <h2>Establishing Freedom</h2>
    <p>Never a toy environment, All of Emacspeak is now
    voluntarily bundled with all major Linux
    distributions. Though designed to be modular, distributors
    have freely chosen to bundle the entire system without any
    undue pressure. The integrity of the Emacspeak codebase is
    ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform used to
    develop the software. Extensive studies have shown that
    thanks to these features, users consider Emacspeak to be
    absolutely priceless. Thanks to this wide-spread user demand,
    the present version is being made available at the same zero
    cost as earlier releases. At the same time, Emacspeak
    continues to innovate in the area of speech interaction and
    carries forward the well-established Open Source tradition of
    introducing user interface features that eventually show up
    in luser environments. On this theme, when challenged by a
    proponent of a crash-prone but well-marketed windowing system
    with the assertion <q>Emacs is a system from the 70's</q>,
    the creator of Emacspeak expressed surprize at the unusual
    candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular
    idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to
    where the Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts
    welcomed this refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and
    Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are reeling from the Fear
    Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by complex software
    systems backed by even more convoluted press releases.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Independent Test Results</h2>
    
    <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern
      software, Emacspeak can be easily uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the
      computer.  These same tests also revealed that once
      uninstalled, the user stopped functioning altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator
      of Emacspeak once pointed out that these results 
      re-emphasize the user-centric design of Emacspeak; <q>It is
        the user --and not the computer-- that stops
      functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note from Aster and Bubbles</strong>: (UnDoctored Videos Inc. is currently looking for
      volunteers to star in a video demonstrating such complete
      user failure).

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
Emacspeak-19 --AKA WorkDog-- is designed to enhance user
productivity at work and leisure.  Emacspeak-18.0 --code named
GoodDog-- continues the the Emacspeak tradition of enhancing user
productivity and thereby reduces total cost of ownership.
Emacspeak-17.0 --code named HappyDog-- enhances user productivity
by exploiting today's evolving WWW standards.  Emacspeak-16.0
--code named CleverDog-- was the follow-up to SmartDog --and
continued the tradition of working better, faster, smarter.
Emacspeak-15.0 --code named SmartDog--followed up on TopDog as
the next in a continuing a series of award-winning audio desktop
releases from Emacspeak Inc.  Emacspeak-14.0 --code named
TopDog--was the first release of this millennium.  Emacspeak-13.0
--codenamed YellowLab-- was the closing release of the
20th. century.  Emacspeak-12.0 --code named GoldenDog-- first
leveraged the evolving sematnic WWW to provide task-oriented
speech access to electronic information on the Internet.
Emacspeak-11.0 --code named Aster-- went the final step in making
Linux a <strong>zero-cost Internet access</strong> solution for
blind and visually impaired users.  Emacspeak-10.0 --(AKA
Emacspeak-2000) code named WonderDog-- was the last in a series
of award-winning software releases designed to make eyes-free
computing a productive and pleasurable experience.  Emacspeak-9.0
--(AKA Emacspeak 99) code named BlackLab-- continued to innovate
in the areas of speech interaction and interactive
accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-98++) code named
BlackDog-- was a major upgrade to the speech output extension to
Emacs.
    </p>
    
    <p>Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois)
      was released as OpenSource on the Internet in May 1995 as
      the first complete speech interface to UNIX
      workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio
      desktop to provide the first fully interactive
    speech-enabled WebTop.</p>

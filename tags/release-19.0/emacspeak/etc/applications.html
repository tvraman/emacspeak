<p>
      Many shell-based tools., e.g., the napster.pl from
      Lincoln Stein's Napster package can be run effectively
      from within an Emacs shell.  In such cases, Emacspeak
      utilities like <em>filtertext</em> and
      <em>gridtext</em> can be used to advantage in
      efficiently scanning and filtering the program output.
      Finally, note that when using full screen applications
      like PINE and Lynx when run within the Emacs terminal
      emulator (provided by package eterm) Emacspeak
      functions like a traditional screenreader.

This is the changelog entry for a806a70f6the patch that gets Emacspeak
compiling under elpa.  It also eliminates warnings when running under
Emacs built with native-compilation.

I'm indebted to Stefan Monnier for his patch  that finally untangled
the inter-dependencies among some of the core Emacs modules.

    Try and make it compilable using the (Non)GNU ELPA scripts.

    * .gitignore: Add ELPA-generated files.
    * .elpaignore: New file.

    * lisp/emacspeak.el: Add `Version:` and `Package-Requires:` headers.
    * lisp/emacspeak-preamble.el (acss): Move to `voice-setup.el`.
    * lisp/voice-setup.el: Require `dtk-speak`.
    (acss): Move defstruct from `emacspeak-preamble`.
    (voice-setup): New function, to delay the calls to <foo>-configure-tts
    to when Emacspeak is activated.
    * lisp/dtk-speak.el (dtk-initialize): Call `voice-setup`.
    (tts-get-voice-command, tts-define-voice-from-speech-style)
    (tts-voice-defined-p): Provide dummy default definitions via `defalias`
    so the compiler knows those functions exist.
    (ems-with-messages-silenced): Explicitly declare
    `emacspeak-speak-messages` as dynbound for when this macro gets used in
    a file that does not require `emacspeak-speak`.

    * lisp/emacspeak-speak.el: Require `voice-defs` and `emacspeak-sounds`.
    (ems-with-errors-silenced): Don't bind `emacspeak-speak-errors` since
    it's not used anywhere.
    (emacspeak-speak-load-filter-settings): Make sure `ems--fastload` exists.
    (minibuffer-local-completion-map): Use `kbd` so it works even `ems-kbd` is
    not yet defined.

    * lisp/emacspeak-sounds.el (emacspeak-auditory-icon-function)
    (emacspeak-auditory-icon): Move them before first use.
    (emacspeak-sounds-define-theme-if-necessary): Make sure
    `ems--fastload` exists.

    * sounds/*/define-theme.el: Require `emacspeak-sounds`.

    * lisp/sox-gen.el: Require `dtk-speak`.

    * lisp/emacspeak-wizards.el: Require `color`.

    * lisp/emacspeak-pronounce.el: Require emacspeak-sounds.
    (emacspeak-pronounce-load-dictionaries): Make sure `ems--fastload` exists.

    * lisp/emacspeak-outline.el (outline-flag-region):
    Declare `ems--voiceify-overlays` as dynbound.
    (outline-up-heading): Remove declaration of `emacspeak-speak-errors`
    which should have been in `ems-with-errors-silenced`.

    * lisp/emacspeak-autoload.el (dtk-quiet): Declare as dynbound.

    * lisp/gm-nnir.el:
    * lisp/plain-voices.el:
    * lisp/outloud-voices.el:
    * lisp/mac-voices.el:
    * lisp/espeak-voices.el:
    * lisp/dectalk-voices.el:
    * lisp/amixer.el: Require `emacspeak-preamble`.

    * lisp/ladspa.el, lisp/sox.el: Use `kbd` so it works even `ems-kbd` is
    not yet defined.

    * lisp/emacspeak-xslt.el: Don't autoload variables whose value depends
    on `emacspeak-xslt-directory` which is only defined after
    `emacspeak-preamble` is loaded.

    * lisp/emacspeak-vertico.el: Fix spurious `^L`.

    * lisp/emacspeak-muggles.el (hydra): Don't fetch it automatically,
    it's evil.
    (flycheck): Don't signal an error if it's absent.

    * lisp/Makefile (emacspeak-loaddefs.el): Let `autoloads.el` generate
    the initial form of the file, it does it better.

<p>
Emacspeak Inc (NASDOG: ESPK) --<a href="http://emacspeak.sf.net">http://emacspeak.sf.net</a>--

<p>
With several prominent tweeters expanding coverage of
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">#emacspeak</span>, NASDOG: ESPK has now been consistently trading over
the social net at levels close to that once attained by DogCom
high-fliers—and as of May 2013 is trading at levels close to
that achieved by once better known stocks in the tech sector.

<p>Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides
complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
environments. By seamlessly blending live access to all aspects
of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing
and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak
enables speech access to local and remote information with a
consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of
task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to
the evolving service-oriented social Web cloud.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">



<p>
  Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
used to develop and distribute the software.
</p>
<p>
Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
previous releases.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
</p>
<p>
On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
"Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak
evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
releases.

<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> Independent Test Results:</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">



<p>
Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user &ndash;and not the
computer&ndash; that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

standards. Emacspeak-16.0 &ndash;code named CleverDog&ndash; the follow-up

smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 &ndash;code named SmartDog&ndash;followed up on
TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning
audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 &ndash;code

millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 &ndash;codenamed YellowLab&ndash; was the
closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 &ndash;code named
GoldenDog&ndash; began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide
task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0
&ndash;code named Aster&ndash; went the final step in making Linux a
zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually
impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 &ndash;(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named
WonderDog&ndash; continued the tradition of award-winning software
releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and

named BlackLab&ndash; continued to innovate in the areas of speech
interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 &ndash;(AKA
Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog&ndash; was a major upgrade to the
speech output extension to Emacs.
</p>
<p>
Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

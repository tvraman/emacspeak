*Running Speech Server  remotely

For  using ssh port forwarding, see remote-tts-setup.
Code in remote-tts-setup is also available as a bash function in ../bash-utils/remote.
Reverse port forwarding is the solution I have been using since approx
2011.

** Using SSH

This is legacy and is here for historical reasons, it has not been
used in a long time. Port-forwarding is the recommended solution for
using remote-emacspeak.


0) Make sure you can ssh from the remote machine to the local
machine without providing a password.

1)  Test the ssh speech server by starting 
it from a shell buffer:
tcl <emacspeak-location>/servers/ssh-<synth>
--where <synth> is either dtk-exp or outloud 

2) If you hear the speech server start up cleanly on the
   local machine --all is well, type exit to quit that
   running server.

3) Now use command dtk-select-server to select either
   ssh-outloud or ssh-dtk-exp as your speech server.

** Caveats:

Note that there are some problems you may encounter  when running
simultaneous local and remote sessions of Emacspeak.

Here is a summary:

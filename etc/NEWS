** Bash Utils 

Directory _bash-utils_ contains a collection of useful Bash utilities
for use with Emacspeak --- see [[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/bash-utils/readme.org#L1][bash-utils/Readme.org]].

** Emacspeak Info Pages

There is a new command _emacspeak-open-info_ bound to _C-e TAB_
that opens the Emacspeak online manual for the  version of Emacspeak
in use.

** Managing Shell Buffers

Module _emacspeak-wizards_ provides a set of shell-management commands  
that make it easy to create shell buffers specific to projects and
moving among them. See command _emacspeak-wizards-shell-by-key_ and
customization variable _emacspeak-wizards-project-shells_.
** EWW And EBooks:

Command  _emacspeak-epub-eww_ now loads Emacspeak's directory-specific
settings file if found on the epub-file path.

** Installation:

The install rule in the Makefile is deprecated and has been updated to
display simple installation instructions. 
To install a specific version of Emacspeak:
  1. Download and unpack the latest tarball.
  2. make config && make to build Emacspeak
  3. Optional: make espeak to build espeak support.
  4. Optional: make outloud to build ViaVoice outloud support.
  5.  copy the resulting  emacspeak directory to the install location.

** Updated DBus Integration 

Module ~emacspeak-dbus~ --- Emacspeak's DBus Integration --- has been
updated  and now includes support for screen-lock, sleep/resume, and  NM.

** Outloud is Easier To Install On 64-Bit Systems 

The ViaVoice Outloud server is now much easier to install on 64-bit
systems, thanks to
[[http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2017/01/fun-with-tts-voxin-and-ladspa.html][Voxin 1.6]]. With this,  the Emacspeak speech-server works with the
default 64-bit  _tclsh_ executable.
The installed Emacspeak requires _Voxin 1.6_, make sure to install
that upgrade first if you  have an  older Voxin installation.

implemented using *NodeJS* to provide audio-formatted mathematics.

powerful tool for semantic searches over elisp source code.

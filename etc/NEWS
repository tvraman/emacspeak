Emacspeak News --History Of User-Visible Changes

* Emacspeak 54 --- Emacspeak 53 User Visible Changes

This version requires Emacs-27.1 or later.


** Capitalization And AllCaps

Emacspeak used to convey capitalization and all-caps via beeps when
options _dtk-capitalize_ and/or _dtk-allcaps_ were turned on. 
This
worked wlel with the Dectalk that could splice in tones, but doesn't
work well with other engines.  As of this version, Emacspeak replaces
thos beeps with short utterances --- _cap_ for an initial capital
letter, and _ac_ for a word in all-caps. 

Those options have been replaced with a single _dtk-caps_ option that
 is now on by default in all programming modes.

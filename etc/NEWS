* Emacspeak 46 -- Emacspeak 46 User Visible Changes
** Updated DBus Integration 

Module ~emacspeak-dbus~ --- Emacspeak's DBus Integration --- has been
updated  and now includes support for screen-lock, sleep/resume, and  NM.

** Outloud is Easier To Install On 64-Bit Systems 

The ViaVoice Outloud server is now much easier to install on 64-bit
systems, thanks to
[[http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2017/01/fun-with-tts-voxin-and-ladspa.html][Voxin 1.6]]. With this,  the Emacspeak speech-server works with the
default 64-bit  _tclsh_ executable.
The installed Emacspeak requires _Voxin 1.6_, make sure to install
that upgrade first if you  have an  older Voxin installation.

Emacspeak 46 will therefore no longer install scripts _32-outloud_  or
any of  the other _32-*_ server scripts.

    <p>Emacspeak Inc (NASDOG: ESPK) announces immediate world-wide
    availability of Emacspeak 23.0 --a powerful audio desktop for
    leveraging today's evolving semantic WWW.</p>

    <p>Emacspeak is a speech interface that allows visually
    impaired users to interact independently and efficiently with
    the computer. Audio formatting --a technique pioneered by <a
    href=
    "http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html">
    AsTeR</a>-- and full support for <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/Press/1998/CSS2-REC">W3C's Aural CSS
    (ACSS)</a> allows Emacspeak to produce rich aural presentations
    of electronic information. By seamlessly blending all aspects
    of the Internet such as Web-surfing and messaging, Emacspeak
    speech-enables local and remote information via a consistent
    and well-integrated user interface. Available free of cost on
    the Internet, Emacspeak has dramatically changed how the author
    and hundreds of blind and visually impaired users around the
    world interact with the personal computer and the Internet. A
    rich suite of <a href="applications.html">task-oriented
    tools</a> provides efficient speech-enabled access to the audio
    desktop and evolving semantic WWW. When combined with Linux
    running on low-cost PC hardware, Emacspeak/Linux provides a
    reliable, stable speech-friendly solution that opens up the
    Internet to visually impaired users around the world.</p>

    <h2><a id="benefits" name="benefits">Benefits</a></h2>

    <p>Emacspeak provides complete eyes-free access to daily
    computing tasks. By providing fluent spoken access to local and
    remote electronic information, the system opens up the wealth
    of information available on the Internet to visually impaired
    users. See this <a href="smithsonian/study.html">case study</a>
    for details.</p>

    <p>Emacspeak introduces several improvements and innovations
    when compared with <em>screenreaders</em> designed to allow
    blind users to interact with personal computers. Unlike
    screenreaders that speak the contents of a visual display,
    Emacspeak speaks the underlying information. As an example,
    using a calendar application with a screenreader results in the
    blind user hearing a sequence of meaningless numbers; In
    contrast, Emacspeak speaks the relevant date in an easy to
    comprehend manner.</p>

    <p>The system deploys the innovative technique of audio
    formatting to increase the band-width of aural communication;
    changes in voice characteristic and inflection combined with
    appropriate use of non-speech auditory icons are used
    throughout the user interface to create the equivalent of
    spatial layout, fonts, and graphical icons so important in the
    visual interface. This provides rich contextual feedback and
    shifts some of the burden of listening from the cognitive to
    the perceptual domain.</p>

    <p>Finally, Emacspeak like Linux is completely free; in
    contrast, commercially available screenreaders typically double
    the cost of a personal computer. These innovations have
    together resulted in the system significantly increasing the
    ability of visually impaired individuals throughout the world
    to more effectively use information technology for work and
    leisure.</p>

    <p>If you have found an innovative use for Emacspeak, you can
    be listed here.</p>

    <h3>ETC ---Engima Technologies Corp</h3>

    <p>This project is using Emacspeak to produce talking audio
    books from freely available electronic texts. From the creator
    of the project:</p>

    <blockquote>
      these audio products are free to individuals. we charge
      institutions for prepping their documents. by combining books
      from the gutenberg collection and emacspeak, i can make a
      large number of classics available to children that don't
      have anyone to read to them. at the same time, on the
      broadcasts, i can introduce these children to jazz and
      classical music. This is also valuable for the blind, and for
      english-as-a-second-language students. I believe it to have
      value for home schoolers. as they age, they can use the web
      links to further their musical education, and branch out into
      math and science. high school students can create radio plays
      from these [gutenberg] texts for performance. it is a
      concrete demonstration of grammatical knowledge, style and
      performance practice to shift a third-person novel to a first
      person play. House of Mapuhi on this month's broadcast is a
      good example. over time, this will fill the repository with
      NEW works. and high school computer geeks can use these
      materials and software to start their own broadcast facility.

    for other synthesizers are available from <a href=
    "http://www.mv.com/ipusers/vanzandt/">Jim Van Zandt's home
    page</a>. Developing speech servers for additional TTS engines
    is easily achieved by examining the source code of one  of the
    existing servers.</p>

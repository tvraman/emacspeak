<P>

Emacspeak Inc (NASDOG: ESPK) today announced  the immediate
world-wide availability of Emacspeak 12.0 --a powerful audio
desktop for leveraging today's evolving semantic WWW.


<h2>What Is It?</h2>

Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides <em>
complete eyes-free</em> access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
environments. By seamlessly blending all aspects of the Internet
such as Web-surfing and electronic messaging into the audio
desktop, Emacspeak enables speech access to local and remote
information with a consistent and well-integrated user
interface.  A rich suite of task-oriented 
tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to the
evolving semantic WWW.  With support for the freely
downloadable IBM ViaVoice Outloud speech synthesis engine,
Emacspeak now turns Linux into the <STRONG>first zero-cost
Internet access</STRONG> solution for blind and visually
impaired users.

<h2>Code Name Note</h2>

After 10 years of loyal service, Aster Labrador retired from
active duty as a guide-dog on November 29, 1999.  She agreed
to stay on as Emacspeak's press contact for the immediate
future, but gave up the marketing role after just one week
--she passed away peacefully December 5, 1999.  this release
is code named GoldenDog to welcome Hubbell (Bubbles)
Labrador, a frisky young yellow Labrador who stepped into
Aster's shoes earlier this year.

<h2>Major Enhancements</h2>
<ol>
<li> Task-oriented web tools to exploit the evolving
semantic WWW.
<li> Further enhancements to single-click web-search.
<li> Speech-enabled access to CVS.
<li> Speech-enabled access to  the new Java debugger.
<li>  RPM package to allow single click installation.
</ol>
<p>See the NEWS file  for additional details. The Emacspeak
source distribution now includes a structured FAQ list designed to
introduce new and old users to the Emacspeak environment.</p>
<h2>Opening Doors To A Windows-Free 2000</h2>
Emacspeak is now voluntarily bundled with all major Linux distributions.
Extensive studies have shown that users consider Emacspeak to be
absolutely priceless. Thanks to this wide-spread user demand, the
present version is being made available at the same zero cost as
earlier releases. At the same time, Emacspeak-2000 continues to
innovate in the area of speech interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in commercial user
environments. On this theme, when recently challenged by a
proponent of a crash-prone but well-marketed windowing system with
the assertion "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
Emacspeak expressed surprize at the unusual candor manifest in the
assertion that it would take popular idiot-proof interfaces until
the year 2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
today. Upon hearing this, the said proponent of the crash-prone
system turned blue in the face (screen), crashed to the floor and
refused to get booted (ever again). Industry experts welcomed this
refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
convoluted press releases.


<h2>Independent Test Results</h2>


Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern
software, Emacspeak can be easily uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the
computer.  These same tests also revealed that once
uninstalled, the user stopped functioning altogether.

Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator
of Emacspeak once pointed out that these results 
re-emphasize the user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is
the user --and not the computer-- that stops
functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".
<P>


<STRONG>Note from Aster and Bubbles</STRONG>: (UnDoctored Videos Inc. is currently looking for
volunteers to star in a video demonstrating such complete
user failure).


<h2>History</h2> Emacspeak-12.0 --code named GoldenDog--
leverages the evolving sematnic WWW to provide task-oriented
speech access to electronic information on the Internet.
Emacspeak-11.0 --code named Aster-- goes the final step in
making Linux a <STRONG>zero-cost Internet access</STRONG>
solution for blind and visually impaired users.
Emacspeak-10.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named WonderDog--
was the last in a series of award-winning software releases
designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and
pleasurable experience.  Emacspeak-9.0 --(AKA Emacspeak 99)
code named BlackLab-- continued to innovate in the areas of
speech interaction and interactive
accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-98++) code
named BlackDog-- was a major upgrade to the speech output
extension to Emacs.  <p>Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois)
was released as OpenSource on the Internet in May 1995 as
the first complete speech interface to UNIX
workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio
desktop to provide the first fully interactive
speech-enabled WebTop.</p> <h2>Obtaining Emacspeak</h2>

    1. Purpose

    The Digital Talking Book Document Type Definition (DTD) provides
    the means to mark up the text of a document to permit support for
    the combination of professional narration and navigation into that
    narration. It also facilitates the output of a document's content in
    a variety of accessible formats. The markup tags in the book convey
    its content in structure, and contain some metadata about the book
    content and its structure.

    The Document Type Definition names and defines the allowable element
    types, their allowable content, and their attributes. Correct markup
    of the text of the book permits the textual material to be synchronized
    using SMIL [SMIL2.0] files with the professionally narrated version of
    that book. The synchronization can permit concurrent display of the
    text being narrated. The textual content can be searched in context to
    locate material desired for narration.

    More detailed documentation of this dtbook dtd [DTBOOKV110DTD] is
    available as an html document. See [DTBOOKV110DOC].

    1.1. Prior Related Work

    The DAISY (Digital Audio-based Information SYstem) Consortium
    contributed substantially to the development of this DTD.
    This application of XML is the next generation after several DAISY
    versions of 2.X specifications, see [DAISY202].

    The DAISY Statement of Principles for the Creation and Production
    of Accessible Books and Materials [DAISY-2-GUIDELINES] represents
    the minimum standard to be met by Libraries of the Blind and producers
    of alternative format materials.

    Its Navigation Control Center (NCC) provided for synchronizing
    document structure with narration.

    The NCC evolved into an XML application called the "Navigation Control
    File for XML applications" (NCX). Its content is derived from
    the markup of documents tagged using the dtbook DTD. Richer
    structuring capability is one of the objectives of that DTD. The
    Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language [SMIL2.0] is used
    to provide synchronized narrations and text. The NCX provides
    navigation using the identified elements of documents tagged to this DTD.

    The dtbook DTD includes many, but not all, of the element types found
    in both the [HTML401STRICT] and [XHTML11STRICT] strict DTDs. HTML
    authoring tools permit those additional element tags, and may ignore
    the additional tags that are dtbook-specific. The lowercase names
    from XHTML are used, rather than the uppercase names from HTML.

    1.2. Evolution from HTML and XHTML

    Dtbook110 has 79 element types. It shares 47 element types with the
    HTML4.0 Strict DTD [HTML401STRICT] (as adjusted to use the lower-case
    names consonant with the XHTML Strict DTD [XHTML11STRICT]). It omits
    30 element types from them, and has 32 unique element types.

    Endtag markup is sometimes optional in HTML. It is required for use with
    xhtml and dtbook. Any XML application [XML12] requires endtags, or their
    abbreviated form for empty elements, such as "<br />". The benefit of
    including endtags is that the tagged document has dependable structure
    that can be validated against the dtbook dtd.

    Some tools available for browsing HTML may be used with dtbook
    material, at the expense of their discarding or ignoring some specific
    tagging and attributes that are not part of HTML 4.0. A CSS-based
    stylesheet [CSS1] or [CSS2] that identifies the presentation expectations
    for the HTML and non-HTML tags, or a filter to map those tags onto
    suitable HTML tags can provide appropriate visual presentation.

    2. Document Tagging Content

    A Digital Talking Book document is an XML application. Therefore, it
    must begin with the XML processing instruction, followed by the DOCTYPE
    declaration.

    2.1. XML Processing Instruction

    The XML Processing Instruction identifies the version of XML, and the
    optional character set encoding for the document:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

    2.2. Character Set Encodings

    The character set in which the document is encoded is identified by
    one of a number of strings. All XML applications are expected to be able
    to recognize the UNICODE/ISO/IEC 10646 encodings "UTF-8" and "UTF-16"
    [ISO10646].

    Some alternative encodings to "UTF-8" (or "ISO-10646-UCS-2")
    or "UTF-16" (or "ISO-10646-UCS-4") may be used. These include
    "ISO-8859-1", "ISO-8859-2", ... "ISO-8859-9" for parts of ISO 8859.
    See [ISO8859]. Note that US-ASCII (i.e. encoding all characters over
    decimal 127, e.g. from 128 to 255, as &#nnn;) is conformant with UTF-8
    (and ISO-8859-1, HTTP's default header encoding.)

    Also, the values "ISO-2022-JP", "Shift_JIS", or "EUC-JP" can be used
    for various Japanese encoded forms of JIS X-0208-1997. See [JIS].

    The Unicode characters may be represented as their code points,
    using the form &#hHHHH; where HHHH is a hexadecimal value formed
    from the digits 0-9 and letters A-F. Any initial H with value "0"
    may be elided.

    2.3. DOCTYPE Declaration

    The document type declaration, the DOCTYPE, follows. It has several forms.
    The simpler form assumes that the proper version of the dtbook DTD
    is in the same directory as the dtbook file itself.

        <!DOCTYPE dtbook SYSTEM
            "dtbook110.dtd">

    A more general form provides the PUBLIC URI from which the SYSTEM
    filename can be substituted, should that system copy be missing:

        <!DOCTYPE dtbook PUBLIC
            "http://www.loc.gov/nls/z3986/v100/dtbook110.dtd"
            "dtbook110.dtd">

    That assumes the URI can be reached, which may not be true for
    portable dtbook players.

    The still more general form recommended for xml applications [XML12] is:

        <!DOCTYPE dtbook PUBLIC
            "-//NISO//DTD dtbook v1.1.0//EN"
            "dtbook110.dtd">

    where the Formal Public Identifier (FPI) on the second line is converted
    to the URI where it may be publicly found:

        http://www.loc.gov/nls/z3986/v100/dtbook110.dtd

    The [OASIS-TR9401] Entity Management Catalog provides an indirect
    means to provide that mapping from FPI to the dtd.

    That catalog is more generally useful to provide the mapping from
    any external entity names (such as modules) to URIs where they may
    be found.

    Note that the reference above is to a particular version of the DTD,
    distinguished by the "v110".

    2.4. Digital Talking Book File MIME Type

    A Digital Talking Book document is tagged to the dtbook XML
    application. Its MIME media-type is "text/xml". The tagged book
    filename should have suffix ".xml". See [RFC2045].

    3. Modular Extension to the DTD

    The dtbook DTD has two parameter entities defined that provide means
    to allow an individual book to modularly extend the content models
    for its block and inline parameter entities:

        <!ENTITY % externalblock "">
        <!ENTITY % externalinline "">

    These parameter entities appear in corresponding block and inline
    content models. With this "" content they have no effect on books
    tagged to the dtbook DTD. In a book that needs a modular extension,
    values are given by redefinition in the internal subset of that book.
    This extends the dtbook DTD without having to change it.

    A book can augment the dtbook DTD by including other declarations
    or parameter entity references in the internal subset of declarations.
    The internal subset may occur in square brackets following the
    ExternalID and before the concluding ">" of the initial DOCTYPE
    declaration that identifies the dtbook DTD.

    Those additional markup declarations in the internal subset
    take preference over any in the dtbook DTD itself. The effective
    DTD is thereby augmented by the parameter entity values and any other
    declarations of the book's internal subset. When a given parameter
    entity declaration appears more than once in the external modules and
    the dtbook DTD, the first occurrence of that declaration is the one
    that takes effect, with modules in the internal subset being processed
    in order, before the DTD itself.

    For example:

        <!DOCTYPE dtbook SYSTEM
        "dtbook.dtd"
        [
            <!ENTITY % dramaModule SYSTEM "drama.dtd">
            %dramaModule;
            <!ENTITY % externalblock "| drama">
            <!ENTITY % externalinline "| stagedir">
        ]>

    The "%dramaModule;" invocation causes all declarations made within
    dramaModule to become the initial part of the dtbook DTD. Within the
    book, the empty entity declarations for both % externalblock and for
    % externalinline are replaced by these new definitions. Thus the
    block element drama can appear wherever block elements may occur in
    dtbook. Similarly any actual content needed for %externalinline;
    (" | stagedir" is shown above) can appear in that extension to wherever
    %inline; appears in the DTD.

    More than one module may be needed and included in a book, for example
    both poem and drama can appear in the internal subset of the book.
    For example, the internal subset of the book could contain:

        <!DOCTYPE dtbook SYSTEM
        "dtbook.dtd"
        [
            <!ENTITY % poemModule SYSTEM "poem.dtd">
            %poemModule;
            <!ENTITY % dramaModule SYSTEM "drama.dtd">
            %dramaModule;
            <!ENTITY % externalblock "| poem | stanza | verse | drama">
            <!ENTITY % externalinline "| stagedir">
        ]>

    Such external modules need to include the definitions of any parameter
    entities that are used in the modules since their definitions are needed
    before they can be expanded in their references. They cannot depend
    on parameter entities in the SystemLiteral or PubidLiteral.

    Note that arbitrary external modules from other sources may not have
    all the needed attributes. XML allows augmentation of ATTLISTs in the
    internal subset. Additional attribute names can be added to an
    associated element type. Any redefinitions of a particular named
    attribute resulting from presence in the internal subset have
    precedence.

    Also note that element name collisions may be possible, with names
    in those modules and associated content models overriding those in
    dtbook. For modules under control of dtbook design, such collisions
    can be avoided. A more general solution uses namespace prefixes to
    element and attribute names to clearly indicate the module source.

    Following the document type declaration, the fully marked-up document
    appears, including tags from the external modules found in the internal
    subset. Declarations in the internal subset or in external entity
    references (such as %dramaModule;) referenced therein take precedence
    over like-named ones from the external entity containing the base DTD
    (that is, dtbook110.dtd). Thus the declarations from the module
    containing the drama and poem tags are included along with the tags
    in the base DTD (that is dtbook110.dtd) that are not duplicated or
    redefined in the drama module. So if a <p> tag is defined in the drama
    module, its definition overrides that of the <p> tag in dtbook. There
    is an exception: an ATTLIST for elementname that adds attributes from
    the internal subset augments the ATTLIST attributes with different
    attribute names in the ATTLIST of the same elementname in the
    dtbook110.dtd.

    Note that tools and players processing any extended markup that affects
    navigation structure will need to know of those modular extensions.

    The form above for augmenting the dtbook dtd through the document's
    internal subset does not require the XML namespace mechanism, with
    its namespace-specific prefix on element and attribute names to
    disambiguate any potential name collisions. However, use of XML
    namespaces [XML-NAMES] is not precluded.

<!--========================= Character Entities ==========================-->

<!--HB: 2001-12-20 Character entities amplified comments. -->

<!-- Character entities for interoperability.
        The five following characters may have special markup meaning,
        so are expressed as character entities in text. They can be
        recognized since they are preceded by "&" and followed by ";".
        The notation below, #xHHHH (or #xHH) where H is a hexadecimal-number
        (formed from 0-9, A-F), indicates the character code position
        in Unicode/ISO-10646 [ISO10646]. Note that the "<" and "&"
        characters in the declarations of "lt" and "amp" are doubly escaped
        to meet the requirement that entity replacement be well-formed.
        As these entities occur in the first plane of Unicode, with encodings
        the same as ASCII, the "00" prefix can be implied, so omitted.
    -->

<!ENTITY lt   "&#x0026;#x003C;" >
    <!-- "&#38;#60;"  < Less than, normally starts a tag. -->

<!ENTITY gt   "&#x003E;" >
    <!-- "&#62;"      > Greater than, normally ends a tag. -->

<!ENTITY amp  "&#x0026;#x0026;" >
    <!-- "&#38;#38;"  & Ampersand, normally begins a character entity
         reference. -->

<!ENTITY apos "&#x0027;" >
    <!-- "&#39;"      ' Neutral Quote, Apostrophe, if needed within an
         attribute string so quoted. -->

<!ENTITY quot "&#x0022;" >
    <!-- "&#34;"      " Quotation mark, if needed within an attribute string
         so quoted. -->

<!-- Three larger character sets included in HTML 4.0 are omitted here:
        HTMLlat1.ent, HTMLsymbol.ent, and HTMLspecial.ent.
        Unicode [ISO10646] is available to XML applications, so these
        characters are available. The initial processing instruction that
        identifies dtbook as an XML application should use a more inclusive
        encoding, as described at the start of section 2.

    should the values differ, the xml:lang takes precedence.
    See [RFC1556] for handling bi-directional text in MIME.

<!ENTITY % showin
    "showin (xxx|xxp|xlx|xlp|bxx|bxp|blx|blp) #IMPLIED" >
    <!--showin attribute applies for text elements to permit identification
        of the kinds of display appropriate for the element, so presentation
        choice by the reader among alternative readings can be provided, when
        appropriate. Values of showin are coded with three letters in order:
        "b"=Braille, "l"=Largeprint, and "p"=Print; or "x"=inappropriate:

            Value  Braille  Largeprint Print   Interpretation

            "xxx"                              hide
            "xxp"                      p       print only
            "xlx"           l                  largeprint only
            "xlp"           l          p       largeprint and print

            "blp"   b       l          p       braille, largeprint, and print

        There is no default value; this attribute value is implied
        from the most immediate ancestor that specifies a value.
        The usual default for showin is 'blp'. If only one showin
        value is needed it should be included with <book>.

        Different content for the same element (usually <prodnote>) meeting
        different needs is possible, with showin serving as a switch to
        differentiate among them. Both largeprint and print are appropriate
        for screen rendering as well as printing. Different corresponding
        styles may be appropriate.

        It is possible to include equivalent content from any major structure
        below <book> to provide the different content suitable for different
        media. These would be independent, sharing no direct content, possibly
        having common references to images, with different accompanying text
        descriptions.

    "span" causes the attributes of one
    col element to apply to more than one column, extending in the
    writing direction for the language. Span is ignored if
    any <col> are present.

    "width" specifies the width of the columns, e.g.

        width='0.5*'      relative width of 0.5

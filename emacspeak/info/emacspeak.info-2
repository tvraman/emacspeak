Using Online Help With Emacspeak.
*********************************

   Emacs provides an extensive online help system for helping you learn
about various aspects of using Emacs. Emacspeak provides online help for
its various extensions using this same help system.  This chapter
explains how to use the online help facilities in order to empower you
in discovering powerful and versatile working techniques that will make
you more and more productive in your day to day computing.

   The online help options are accessed via the `C-h' prefix key, which
must be followed by an additional letter or control character to
designate the kind of help desired.   For example, `C-h t'
`help-with-tutorial' visits the Emacs tutorial in a new buffer; `C-h i'
`info' enters the Info documentation system, from which you can read
Texinfo manuals that have been installed on your system, including the
Emacs and Emacspeak documentation; and `C-h k' `describe-key' provides
a description of the Emacs function which is bound to the next key that
you type.  For learning about the various  options  that are available
via the `C-h' mechanism described above, view the online help for
command `help-for-help' bound to `C-h C-h' --using what has been
described so far, you would achieve this by pressing `C-h k' followed
by `C-h C-h'.

   Emacspeak users should note that online help is typically displayed
in a separate Emacs window. Where it makes sense to do so, Emacspeak
will automatically speak the displayed help.  Once you've asked for
help, you can have the displayed documentation as many times as you
wish using Emacspeak command `emacspeak-speak-help' bound to `C-e h'.
If you want to move through the displayed help a line at a time, switch
to the buffer where the help is displayed -the buffer is called
`*Help*'.

   Often, in adding an auditory interface to an Emacs extension, such
as a web browser or mail reader, Emacspeak defines additional commands
and key bindings which enhance the functionality of the spoken feedback
provided by the application. This manual does not purport to document
all such commands. It is important, therefore, when learning to use the
various Emacs extensions which comprise the `audio desktop' (*note
Audio Desktop::) that you take advantage of online help to obtain
details of any context-specific features provided by Emacspeak.  The
following two commands are of particular importance in this regard:

   * `C-h m' `describe-mode' explains which major and minor modes are
     currently in effect, and lists the commands and key bindings
     associated with them.

   * `C-h b' `describe-bindings' lists all of the key bindings which are
     currently defined.

   The importance of these help functions can be illustrated by the
Emacs/W3 web browser. When point is positioned inside a table, certain
key bindings are established with which you can access Emacspeak
commands that make it possible to read the rows and columns of the
table and explore its structure efficiently. To get a description of
these key bindings, you can use W3 to visit the sample HTML file
supplied as part of the Emacspeak distribution, and, after having moved
point onto the first row of the table, issue the command `C-h m'
`describe-mode' to create a help buffer containing an explanation of
the features offered by W3 mode.

   Emacspeak supplements the online help facilities available within
Emacs by defining several commands of its own, as follows:

   * `C-h c-e' `describe-emacspeak' presents a list of standard
     Emacspeak commands.

   * `C-e F' `emacspeak-view-emacspeak-faq' opens a new buffer
     containing the Emacspeak FAQ, a list of frequently asked questions
     about Emacspeak together with their answers.

   * `C-e C-h' `emacspeak-learn-mode' enters a mode in which the
     function of every key that you type is spoken; this mode can be
     terminated with the `C-g' `keyboard-quit' command.

   * `M-x emacspeak-generate-documentation' prompts for the name of a
     file in which it saves an automatically generated summary of all
     Emacspeak commands.

   Emacs - The extensible, self-documenting editor, derives its
functionality from its powerful extension mechnaism. This extension
mechanism is used to implement many user-level applications such as mail
readers, WWW browsers, software development environments and so on.
This chapter gives directions on how to locate the right Emacs package
for addressing specific tasks.  The chapter is organized into logical
sections that each pertain to a specific class of tasks; in dividual
subsections within a section give a brief overview of particular Emacs
packages that have been speech-enabled.

Document Authoring
==================

   The Emacspeak environment provides a rich collection of structured
document authoring tools.  These are well-suited for working in an
eyes-free environment -you clearly do not want to use a What You See Is
What You Get (WYSIWYG) authoring tool if you cannot see what you're
getting.  Structure-based authoring tools allow you to focus on the act
of content creation, leaving the minutiae of visual layout to the
computer.

* Search replace and spell check::   Fixing errors.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Creating Well-formatted Documents,  Next: Search replace and spell check,  Up: Document Authoring

Creating Well-formatted Documents
---------------------------------

   Before authoring a document, decide its primary audience if the
document contains relatively simple content e.g., no mathematical
equations etc.  and is primarily targetted at the WWW,  you are
probably better off using HTML.  You can create well-structured HTML
documents with the help of package `html-helper-mode' available from
`ftp://ftp.reed.edu/pub/src/html-helper-mode.tar.gz'.  Package
`html-helper-mode' is speech-enabled by Emacspeak to provide auditory
icons, structured navigation and outlines, as well as voice locking for
audio formatted feedback as you work.

   If the document being authored is more complex, you are usually
better off creating it in LaTeX.  Note that LaTeX documents can be
converted to HTML either via package `tth' or package `latex2html'
-both available on the WWW.

   The TeX family of typesetting languages  is suitable for producing
well-formatted documents in an eyes-free environment.  Unlike WYSIWYG
environments, the author  of a TeX or LaTeX document works with the
content of the document, leaving it to the formatting system (TeX) to
format the document for good visual presentation.

   The auctex package is an Emacs extension that facilitates authoring
and maintaining structured documents in TeX and LaTeX.  Package
`bibtex' facilitates maintainance and use of `bibtex' bibliography
databases.  The Texinfo package allows creation of software
documentation that is suitable for both printing as well as online
viewing as hypertext.  Emacspeak speech-enables packages `auctex',
`bibtex' and `texinfo' to provide convenient spoken feedback as you
create and compile documents. For details on using these packages, see
their accompanying online info documentation.

   The most recent version of package `auctex' is always available by
ftp at `ftp://ftp.iesd.auc.dk/pub/emacs-lisp/auctex.tar.gz'.  Packages
`bibtex' and  `texinfo' are part of the standard Emacs distribution.

   As the document preparation system of choice, Emacspeak supports a
fluent speech-enabled interface to editing and formatting LaTeX
documents.  This interface is provided by speech-enabling  _auctex_
mode.

   Mode _auctex_ provides efficient keyboard shortcuts for inserting
and maintaining LaTeX markup as a document is being authored.  All of
these editing commands provide succinct auditory feedback when used
with Emacspeak.  The syntax coloring provided by this mode is extended
to provide _   voice locking_ -- consequently, Emacspeak uses different
voices to speak the embedded markup to set it apart from the content.

   Mode _auctex_ can be used to create empty document templates and to
insert document content at the appropriate places in the template.  The
mode also enables structured navigation of the document as it is being
edited.  Emacspeak speech-enables these template creation and
structured navigation commands to produce auditory icons and succinct
spoken feedback.  For example, while editing, the user can quickly
browse through the sections of the document and have each section title
spoken.  Document elements such as paragraphs and bulleted lists can be
manipulated as logical units.  These features are especially relevant
in an eyes-free environment where the user needs to select logical
parts of the document without having to point at portions of a visual
display.

   Finally, Emacs supports creating and maintaining SGML and XML
documents.  Emacs comes with a fairly simple `sgml-mode' -in addition,
package `psgml' provides sophisticated parsing and validation
facilities for working with SGML and XML documents.  Package `psgml'
can be downloaded from
`http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/public/COMP/info/psgml/psgml_toc.html'.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Search replace and spell check,  Prev: Creating Well-formatted Documents,  Up: Document Authoring

Searching, Replacing, And Spell Checking
----------------------------------------

   Incremental search, a process by which the system prompts the user
for a search string and moves the selection to the next available match
while allowing the user to add more characters to the search string, is
the search technique of choice amongst most Emacs users.  As the system
successively finds each match and provides the user the option of
continuing the search.  Incremental search is a more complex instance of
traditional search interaction because in addition to either stopping or
continuing the search, the user can modify the current search in a
number of ways including specifying a longer (or shorter) search string.

   All of the user commands available during incremental search are
documented in the online Emacs info manual.  These are speech-enabled by
Emacspeak to provide spoken prompts as the dialogue begins; auditory
icons indicate a search hit or search miss as the search progresses.
Along with auditory icons _search-hit_ and _search-miss_ the user also
hears the current line spoken, and in the case of a search hit, the
matching text is _aurally_ highlighted by using the standard audio
formatting technique of changing voice characteristic.  This feedback
proves extremely effective when the search pattern appears several
times on a single line; the user is unambiguously cued to the current
match.

   Search and replace actions are an extension to the basic
conversational gestures of  a search dialogue.  In addition to
specifying a search string, the user also specifies a replacement
string.  On the Emacspeak desktop, this functionality is provided by
command _query-replace_.  The speech-enabled version of this
interaction prompts the user for the search and replacement texts.  The
auditory feedback during the interactive search and replacement process
parallels that described in the case of incremental search.  Audio
formatting to indicate the occurrence that is about to be replaced
proves an effective means of avoiding erroneous modifications to the
text being edited.  As an example, consider using command _
query-replace_ to locate and replace the second occurrence of   foo
with bar in the text

   `Do not change this fool, but change this food.'

   When the search matches the first occurrence of foo  in word _fool_,
the aural highlighting helps the user in  answering "no" in response to
question "should this occurrence be  replaced".  In addition to
allowing the user to supply a  simple "yes or no" answer for each
match, command _    query-replace_ also allows the user to specify a
number of other  valid answers as described  in the online Emacs
documentation.

Spell Checking
**************

   A more complex instance of conversational gesture "search and
replace" is exhibited by standard spell checking dialogues.  Spell
checking differs from the search and replace dialogue described above
in that the search and replacement text is guessed by the system based
on an available dictionary.  Words that are not found in the dictionary
are flagged as potential spelling errors, and the system offers an
interactive search and replace dialogue for each of these possible
errors.  During this dialogue, the system successively selects each
occurrence of the possibly erroneous word and offers a set of possible
replacements.  Unlike in the case of simple search and replace, more
than one possible replacement string is offered, since a potential
spelling error can be corrected by more than one word appearing in the
dictionary.

   In the visual interface, such spell checking dialogues are realized
by displaying the available choices in a pop-up window and allowing the
user to pick a correction Once a correction is selected, the user is
offered the choice of interactively  replacing the erroneous word with
the correction.

   The spell checking interface on the Emacspeak desktop is
speech-enabled to provide fluent auditory feedback.  The visual
interface parallels that described above and is provided by package
`ispell' which is part of the standard Emacs distribution.  Emacspeak
provides a spoken prompt that is composed of the line containing the
possibly erroneous word (which is aurally highlighted to set it apart
from the rest of the text on that line) and the available corrections.
Each correction is prefixed with a number that the user can use to
select it.  Once a correction is selected, the interaction continues
with the query and replace interaction described earlier.  The speech
interface to the spell checker is as fluent as the visual interface.
Notice that Emacspeak users do not need to concern themselves with the
details of the visual display such as "the corrections are displayed in
a window at the top of the screen".

   In addition to the standard spell checker described above, newer
versions of Emacs include an "on-the-fly" spell checker that flags
erroneous words as they are typed.  Emacspeak speech-enables package
`flyspell' so that such erroneous words are aurally highlighted.

Structured Editing And Templates
================================

   Editing documents based on the inherent structure present in the
electronic encoding can be very efficient when using spoken
interaction.  We described mode _ auctex_ -- a specialized interface to
authoring LaTeX documents as a special instance of such structured
editing in *note Document Authoring::.

   The Emacspeak desktop allows the user to efficiently author and
maintain an electronic document based either on the structure present
in the markup (as in the case of mode auctex) or on special outlining
constructs that allow the user to impose a desired logical structure on
the document.  This section describes the effect of speech-enabling
such editing tools and points out the advantages in using these in a
speech oriented interface.

   Template-based authoring -- a technique that allows the user to
create a document by inserting contents into appropriate positions in a
predefined template-- goes hand in hand with such structured editing.
Finally, structured editing can vastly simplify the creation and
maintenance of structured data, for example, the data present in a UNIX
password file.  Such data files are in fact nothing more than a
collection of database records, where each record (or line) consists of
a set of fields delimited by a special character.  Maintaining such
files without exploiting the underlying structure often tends to be
error prone.  We describe editing modes that can exploit such record
structure to provide a fluent editing interface.  Finally, we outline a
speech-enabled interface to a spreadsheet application as a complex
instance of such structured data editing.

File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Outline Editing,  Next: Template-based Authoring,  Up: Structured Editing

Outline Editing
---------------

   All of the various outline editing interfaces on the Emacs desktop
allow the user to _ hide_ or _ show_ the contents at the different
levels of a possibly nested tree structure.     Components of this tree
structure can be manipulated as a unit, e.g., entire subtrees can be
deleted or copied.  Outline editing thus provides an efficient means of
obtaining quick overviews of a document.

   The visual interface displays such hidden content as a series of
ellipses following the visible outline heading.  Emacspeak produces
auditory icon _ ellipses_ when speaking such outline headings.

   The basic _ outline mode_ allows the user to specify the syntax and
level of outline header lines as a regular expression.  This simple
technique can be used to advantage in the structured navigation of
large electronic texts such as those available on the Internet from
online book projects such as project Gutenberg and the Internet
Wiretap.  For example, when this feature is activated while reading the
electronic text of a Shakespearean play, the different acts can be
recognized as separate nodes in the logical structure of the document.
The user can then hide the document body with a single keystroke,
navigate the outline headings to find a particular act, and have that
portion rendered either visually or aurally.  Hiding an outline level
produces auditory icon _ close-object_; exposing a hidden level
produces auditory icon _ open-object_.  For details on using mode
`outline', see the relevant section of the online Emacs info manual.

   The basic outline facility described above is applicable to all
content being edited or browsed on the Emacspeak desktop.  In addition,
Emacspeak has  other specialized outline editing modes such as  _
folding mode_ that provide extended outlining facilities.  In mode _
folding_, the user can create (possibly nested) _ folds_ -- logical
containers of content that are delimited by a special _ fold mark_.
The fold mark is typically a text string that is chosen based on the
type of content that is being manipulated.  Thus, when _ folding_ a
C~program source file, fold marks are created from C~comments.  The
user can _ open_ or _ close_ any or all folds in a document, and these
actions are accompanied by auditory icons _ open-object_ and _
close-object_.  By entering a fold, all editing actions are restricted
to the contents of that fold; this proves a simple yet convenient way
of constraining editing actions such as search and replace to specific
portions of large documents.  Folds can be manipulated as a unit and
can be deleted, copied or moved.

   Mode _ folding_ proves especially effective in maintaining large
software modules.  The technique can be used to advantage by creating
folds for different sections in a module and by further placing each
function appearing in a particular % section in a fold of its own.
Complex functions can themselves be folded into sections where each
section reflects a different stage in the algorithm implemented by that
function.  Thus, the technique of folding can be used as an effective
aid in _ literate_ programming.  I typically write software modules by
first creating an outline structure using folds that reflect the
various components of that module. Next, I populate each fold with the
function signatures and documentation for the functions in each
section.  When I am satisfied with the overall architecture of the
module, I fill in the function skeletons with actual program code.
This technique is used extensively in maintaining  the  Emacspeak code
base.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Template-based Authoring,  Next: Maintaining Structured Data,  Prev: Outline Editing,  Up: Structured Editing

Template-based Authoring
------------------------

   Emacspeak supports two powerful template-based authoring subsystems
that enable the user to quickly create and fill in templates.  _ Dmacro_
(short for "dynamic macros") allows the user to define and invoke
template-based macros that are specialized for creating different types
of content.  For example, when programming in C, the user can invoke
dynamic macros that insert skeletons of standard C constructs with a few
keystrokes.  This form of editing has numerous advantages in creating
consistently structured code when developing large software modules.
Emacspeak speech-enables mode _ dmacro_ to provide succinct spoken
feedback as templates are created and filled.  The user invokes _
dmacro_ via command _ insert dmacro_, which is typically bound to a
single key.  This results in a dialogue where the user is prompted to
pick one of the dynamic macros available in the current context.  If the
users choice can be uniquely completed, that completion is spoken;
otherwise, the list of possible completions based on the available
partial input is spoken, accompanied by auditory icon _ help_.

   An alternative template-editing facility is provided by mode  _
tempo_ This mode is designed to  be used in creating template-based
editing tools for specific markup languages; a good example is mode _
html-helper_, a  mode for creating and updating HTML documents for
publishing on the WWW (see *note Document Authoring::).


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Maintaining Structured Data,  Prev: Template-based Authoring,  Up: Structured Editing

Maintaining Structured Data
---------------------------

   Consider the following entry from file ` /etc/passwd' on my laptop.

   `aster:KlZVoUxwQQBT2:501:100:Aster Labrador:/home/aster:/bin/bash'

   File ` /etc/passwd' is a simple instance of a text file that stores
structured data records as a series of fields delimited by a special
character. Each item in the file acquires _   meaning_ from the _
position_  in which it  occurs   for example, the fifth field contains
the  user name, Aster Labrador.  More generally, structured data where
each field in a record has _   meaning_ is found throughout the desktop
in applications ranging from entries in a rolodex to rows in a
spreadsheet.

   Typically, users do not directly edit the stored representation of
the data. Instead, application front-ends provide a more human-centric
(and hopefully less error prone) user interface for modifying and
maintaining the data.  Thus, spreadsheet applications present the data
as a two dimensional table that is automatically updated to reflect
changes in the underlying data.  The two dimensional table is perhaps
the most commonly found visual front-end to structured data   tables
with row and column headers prove a succinct way of implicitly
displaying the _ meaning_ along with the _   value_ of the fields
making up each data record.

Browsing Structured Information
===============================

   This section describes packages that allow you to browse structured
information  -these are distinct from the tools described in *Note
Structured Editing::,  in that they are typically used for working with
content that is read-only e.g., online documentation.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Messaging,  Next: Editting Program Source,  Prev: Browsing Structure,  Up: Emacs Packages

Electronic Messaging Applications
=================================

   Working with messaging applications involves both authoring and
browsing content.  Emacspeak provides a rich set of speech-enabled
messaging tools.  Further, all of the tools described in the previous
sections integrate smoothly with the messaging applications described
here; this means that you do not need to re-learn a new set of work
habits when dealing with content in your messaging application.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Editting Program Source,  Next: Development Environment,  Prev: Messaging,  Up: Emacs Packages

Editting Program Source Code
============================

   Files containing program source code form a very specific class of
structured documents.  Unlike documents meant for human consumption
that are often only loosely structured, program source (as a concession
to the computer's intolerance of lack of structure) are per force
well-structured and adhere to a fairly stringent  syntax.

   The Emacs environment provides editting modes that are specific to
creating and maintaining software written in most popular programming
languages. Many of these editting modes are speech-enabled by Emacspeak.
Speech-enabling these modes includes providing a rich set of
navigational  commands that allow you to move through the source
efficiently. In addition, Emacspeak's core voice-lock facilities are
used to produce audio formatted output -this helps you spot errors
quickly.

Software Development Environment
================================

   In addition to providing specialized editting modes for creating and
maintaining program source, Emacs provides a rich set of software
development tools that can be combined to create powerful Integrated
Development Environments (IDE).  These IDEs are speech-enabled by
Emacspeak to provide a versatile and powerful  environment for
eyes-free software development.

Desktop Management
==================

   Emacs provides an integrated environment for performing all of ones
day-to-day computing tasks ranging from electronic messaging to software
development.  The environment derives its power from the fact that this
integration allows for content to be handled across different tasks in
a seamless manner.  In order to work effectively with large Emacs
sessions with many documents and applications open at the same time,
the Emacspeak desktop provides a powerful collection of desktop
management tools designed to help the user easily locate objects that
pertain to a given task.

Desktop Applications
====================

Spread Sheets
-------------

   Spreadsheet applications present a two dimensional view of
structured data where the field values are (possibly) mutually
dependent.  On the Emacspeak desktop, a speech-enabled spreadsheet
application can be used to manipulate such data-driven documents%
ranging from simple cheque books and expense reports to  complex
investment portfolios.  Where the traditional visual interface to
spreadsheets is typically independent of the semantics of the data
stored in the spreadsheet, the speech-enabled interface is derived from
the _ meaning_ of the various fields making up the data.   When
presenting such information on a  visual display, implicit visual
layout can be used to cue the user to the meaning of different data
fields.  On the other hand, in the case of an actively scrolling
auditory display, the spoken output needs to explicitly convey both the
value and interpretation of the different data items.  In addition, the
interface needs to enable an active dialogue between user and
application where the user is able to query the system about the
possible meaning of a particular item of data.  Finally, the aural
interface needs to enable _ multiple_ views of the display.  In the
visual interface, such _ multiple_ views are automatically enabled by
the two dimensional layout combined with the eye's ability to move
rapidly around the layout structure.  Thus, while viewing any
particular row of a portfolio, one can immediately see the current
total value as well as the net gain or loss.  The Emacs spread-sheet
package `dismal' can be retrieved from
`ftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/local/fox/dismal'.

Forms Mode
----------

   _ Forms_ mode  an Emacs mode designed to edit structured data
records like the line shown from file ` /etc/passwd' presents a
user-friendly visual interface that displays the field name along with
the field value.  The user can edit the field value and save the file,
at which point the data is written out using the underlying ` :'
delimited representation.  Mode _ forms_ provides a flexible interface
to associating meaning to the fields of such structured data files.
For details on it use, see the forms-mode section of the online Emacs
info documentation.

OCR -Reading Print Documents
----------------------------

   Module `emacspeak-ocr' implements an OCR front-end for the Emacspeak
desktop.

   Page image is acquired using tools from package `SANE' (Scanner
Access Now Easy).  The acquired image is run through the OCR engine if
one is available, and the results placed in a buffer that is suitable
for browsing the results. This buffer is placed in mode
`emacspeak-ocr-mode' a specialized mode for reading and scanning
documents.

Emacspeak OCR Mode
..................

   Emacspeak OCR mode is a special major  mode for document scanning and
OCR.

   Pre-requisites:

   * A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

   * An OCR engine.

   Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have the
utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a tiff file.  Then
set variable EMACSPEAK-OCR-SCAN-IMAGE-PROGRAM to point at this utility.
By default, this is set to `scanimage' which is the image scanning
utility provided by SANE.

   By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired tiff
image; make sure you have a utility like `tiffcp'.  Variable
EMACSPEAK-OCR-COMPRESS-IMAGE is set to `tiffcp' by default; if you use
something else, you should customize this variable.

   Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and working.  By
default this front-end assumes that OCR is available as `/usr/bin/ocr'.

   Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying OCR to it
work independently of Emacs, you can use this Emacspeak front-end to
enable easy OCR access from within Emacspeak.

   The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command "emacspeak-ocr"
bound to `C-e C-o'.

   This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR commands
bounds to single keystrokes- see the ke-binding list at the end of this
description.  Use Emacs online help facility to look up help on these
commands.

   Mode "emacspeak-ocr-mode" provides the necessary functionality to
scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned images and the
resulting text are saved under directory `~/ocr'; see variable
EMACSPEAK-OCR-WORKING-DIRECTORY.  Invoking command
"emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory" bound to `d' will open this
directory.

   By default, the document being scanned is named `untitled'.  You can
name the document by using command "emacspeak-ocr-name-document" bound
to `n'.  The document name is used in constructing the name of the
image and text files.

   Here is a list of all emacspeak OCR commands along with their
key-bindings and a brief description:
`digit'
     "emacspeak-ocr-page" Jumps to specified page in the OCR output.

`c'
     "emacspeak-ocr-set-compress-image-options"

     Interactively update  image compression options.  Prompts with
     current setting in the minibuffer.  Setting persists for current
     Emacs session.

`i'
     "emacspeak-ocr-set-scan-image-options" Interactively update scan
     image options.  Prompts with current setting in the minibuffer.
     Setting persists for current Emacs session.

Running Terminal Based Applications
***********************************

   You can use the terminal emulator mode to run arbitrary
terminal-based programs from within Emacs.  You open a terminal
emulator buffer using M-x term, with an extra carriage return to accept
the default shell (such as bash).  (Incidently, don't confuse this
command with M-x terminal-emulator, which starts an older terminal
emulator mode not supported by Emacspeak.)

   Three kinds of commands are used within the terminal emulator.
Normal term commands use a prefix of C-c.  The emacspeak commands for
eterm mode use a prefix of C-t.  Anything else is a normal shell
command.

   There are two sub-modes of term mode: char sub-mode and line
sub-mode.  In char sub-mode, emacspeak will only speak the final chunk
of output -typically the last line displayed.  Each character typed
(except `term-escape-char`) is sent immediately.  Use char sub-mode for
screen oriented programs like vi or pine.

   In line sub-mode, program output is spoken if user option
`eterm-autospeak' is turned on.  When you type a return at the end  of
the buffer, that line is sent as input, while return not at end  copies
the rest of the line to the end and sends it.  When using terminal line
mode with option `eterm-autospeak' turned  on, speech feedback is
similar to that obtained in regular `shell-mode'  buffers.

   The default is char sub-mode.  You can switch to line sub-mode with
C-c C-j (recall that control J is a linefeed), and back to char sub-mode
with C-c C-k (think of character spelled with a K).

   Note:  Use char-mode with the terminal emulator for running
screen-oriented programs like Lynx or Pine.  For regular shell
interaction just use M-x shell instead of using the terminal emulator.

Char Sub-mode of Term Mode
==========================

   In char sub-mode of term, each character you type is sent directly to
the inferior process without intervention from emacs, except for the
escape character (usually C-c).

   Here are some of the useful commands for the char sub-mode.  Note
that the usual commands for killing a buffer or switching buffers do
not work in this mode, so new key bindings are supplied.  The first
five commands are different ways of leaving this mode.

`C-c C-j'
`M-x term-line-mode'
     Switch to line sub-mode of term mode.

`C-c o'
`M-x other-window'
     Select the next window on this frame.  All windows on current
     frame are arranged in a cyclic order.  This command selects the
     next window in that order.  If there are no other windows, this
     command does nothing.

`C-c C-f'
`M-x find-file'
     Switch to a buffer visiting a file, creating one if none already
     exists.

`C-c 0'
`M-x delete-window'
     Remove current window from the display.

`C-c k'
`M-x kill-buffer'
     Kill the current buffer.

`C-c C-x C-c'
`M-x save-buffers-kill-emacs'
     Offer to save each buffer, then kill this Emacs process.

`C-c C-d'
`M-x list-directory'
     Display a list of files in or matching DIRNAME, a la `ls'.
     DIRNAME is globbed by the shell if necessary.  Prefix arg (C-u)
     means supply -l switch to `ls'.  The list appears in a second
     window.

`C-c 1'
`M-x delete-other-windows'
     Delete all other windows in the frame, making the current window
     fill its frame.

`C-c C-c'
`M-x term-send-raw'
     Send the last character typed through the terminal-emulator
     without any interpretation.

`C-c ('
`M-x start-kbd-macro'
     Record subsequent keyboard input, defining a keyboard macro.  The
     commands are recorded even as they are executed.  Use C-c ) to
     finish recording and make the macro available.  Use M-x
     name-last-kbd-macro to give it a permanent name.  Prefix arg (C-u)
     means append to last macro defined; This begins by re-executing
     that macro as if you had typed it again.

`C-c )'
`M-x end-kbd-macro'
     Finish defining a keyboard macro.  The definition was started by
     C-c (.  The macro is now available for use via C-c e, or it can be
     given a name with M-x name-last-kbd-macro and then invoked under
     that name.

`C-c e'
`M-x call-last-kbd-macro'
     Call the last keyboard macro that you defined with C-c (.  A
     prefix argument serves as a repeat count.  Zero means repeat until
     error.

   You can get a list of all the key sequences with a C-c prefix by
typing C-c C-h while in this sub-mode.  Some of those commands are only
available in the char sub-mode, while others are generally available.

Line Sub-mode of Term Mode
==========================

   In line sub-mode of term mode, emacs editing commands work normally,
until you type RET which sends the current line to the inferior process.

   Here are some of the useful commands for the line sub-mode of the
term mode.  In addition, the usual commands for handling a buffer work
in this mode (C-x o to switch windows, C-x k to kill a buffer, C-x f to
find a file, and so forth).

`C-c C-k'
`M-x term-char-mode'
     Switch to char sub-mode of term mode.

`C-c C-z'
`M-x term-stop-subjob'
     Stop the current subjob.  Resume the subjob in the foreground with
     the ordinary command fg, or run it in the background with bg.
     WARNING: if there is no current subjob, you can end up suspending
     the top-level process running in the buffer. If you accidentally
     do this, use M-x term-continue-subjob to resume the process. (This
     is not a problem with with most shells, including bash, since they
     ignore this signal.)

`C-c C-\'
`M-x term-quit-subjob'
     Send quit signal to the current subjob.

`C-c C-c'
`M-x term-interrupt-subjob'
     Interrupt the current subjob.

`C-c C-w'
`M-x backward-kill-word'
     Kill characters backward until encountering the end of a word.

`C-c C-u'
`M-x term-kill-input'
     Kill all text from last stuff output by interpreter to point.

`C-c C-a'
`M-x term-bol'
     Goes to the beginning of line, then skips past the prompt, if any.
     If a prefix argument is given (C-u), then no prompt skip - go
     straight to column 0.

`C-c C-d'
`M-x term-send-eof'
     Send an end of file character (EOF) to the current buffer's
     process.

   You can get a list of all the key sequences with a C-c prefix by
typing C-c C-h while in this sub-mode.  Some of those commands are only
available in the line sub-mode, while others are generally available.

Eterm Mode Commands
===================

   The eterm mode maintains a pointer, which is not necessarily the
same as the terminal's cursor.  It is intended to be used in eterm's
char submode.  In char submode, C-t , (that's control-t followed by
comma) will tell you where the eterm pointer is.  C-t C-i will tell you
where the terminal's cursor is.  The top left corner of the window is
"row 0 column 0".

   The eterm pointer can be moved with C-t < (to the top of the screen),
C-t > (to the bottom of the screen), C-t n (to the next line), C-t p (to
the previous line), and C-t . (to the cursor).  Each of these also
speaks the line the pointer moves to.  You can also search forward with
C-t s.

   These commands speak without moving the pointer: C-t l (current
line), C-t w (current word), C-t c (current character), and C-t [space]
(from eterm pointer to cursor).

   You may enter review mode with C-t q.  In review mode, you can search
the buffer and speak its contents, without disturbing the terminal.
Commands for moving the pointer are similar to normal editing commands,
but without a control key: n and p for next and previous line, f and b
for forward and back by characters, < and > for the beginning or end of
the buffer.  c, w, and l speak the current character, word, and line.  s
searches forward (not incrementally).  A comma speaks the pointer
location.  A period moves the pointer to the terminal cursor.  Return to
normal term mode by typing q.

dtk-speak
=========

   Automatically generated documentation for commands defined in module
dtk-speak.

 - dtk-select-server: (PROGRAM)
     ` control e d d '

     Select a speech server interactively.  Argument PROGRAM specifies
     the speech server program.  When called  interactively, The
     selected server is started immediately.

 - dtk-set-chunk-separator-syntax: (S)
     ` control e d RETURN '

     Interactively set how text is split in chunks.  See the Emacs
     documentation on syntax tables for details on how characters are
     classified into various syntactic classes.  Argument S specifies
     the syntax class.

 - dtk-toggle-debug: (&optional FLAG)
     ` control e d b '

     Toggle state of the debug FLAG.  When debugging is on, you can
     switch to the buffer *speaker* to examine the output from the
     process that talks to the speech device by using command C-e d
     C-M-b.  Note: *speaker* is a hidden buffer, ie it has a leading
     space in its name.

 - dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space: ()
     ` control e d SPACE '

     Toggle splitting of speech on white space.  This affects the
     internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split text purely
     by clause boundaries, or also include whitespace.  By default,
     emacspeak sends a clause at a time to the speech device.  This
     produces fluent speech for normal use.  However in modes such as
     `shell-mode' and some programming language modes, clause markers
     appear infrequently, and this can result in large amounts of text
     being sent to the speech device at once, making the system
     unresponsive when asked to stop talking.  Splitting on white space
     makes emacspeak's stop command responsive.  However, when
     splitting on white space, the speech sounds choppy since the
     synthesizer is getting a word at a time.

 - tts-restart: ()
     ` control e control s '

     Use this to nuke the currently running TTS server and restart it.

 - tts-show-debug-buffer: ()
     ` control e d CONTROL meta b '

     Select TTS debugging buffer.

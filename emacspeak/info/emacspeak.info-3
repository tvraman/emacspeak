Emacspeak Commands
******************

dtk-add-cleanup-pattern	Key Sequence: control e d a
===================================================

   Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that are cleaned
up.  Optional interactive prefix arg DELETEs this pattern if previously
added.  Cleaning up repeated patterns results in emacspeak speaking the
pattern followed by a repeat count instead of speaking all the
characters making up the pattern.  Thus, by adding the repeating
pattern `.' (this is already added by default) emacspeak will say "aw
fifteen dot" when speaking the string "..............." instead of
"period period period period "

dtk-notes-shutdown No global keybinding
=======================================

   Shutdown midi system.

dtk-pause	Key Sequence: control e p
===================================

   Pause ongoing speech.  The speech can be resumed with command
`dtk-resume' normally bound to C-e SPC.  Pausing speech is useful when
one needs to perform a few actions before continuing to read a large
document.  Emacspeak gives you speech feedback as usual once speech has
been paused.  `dtk-resume' continues the interrupted speech
irrespective of the buffer in which it is executed.  Optional PREFIX
arg flushes any previously paused speech.

dtk-reset-state	Key Sequence: control e d  cap R
================================================

   Restore sanity to the Dectalk.  Typically used after the Dectalk has
been power   cycled.

dtk-resume	Key Sequence: control e SPACE
========================================

   Resume paused speech.  This command resumes  speech that has been
suspended by executing command `dtk-pause' bound to C-e p.  If speech
has not been paused, and variable `dtk-resume-should-toggle' is t  then
this command will pause ongoing speech.

dtk-select-server	Key Sequence: control e d d
=============================================

   Select a speech server interactively.  Argument PROGRAM specifies
the speech server program.  When called  interactively, The selected
server is started immediately.

dtk-set-character-scale	Key Sequence: control e d f
===================================================

   Set scale FACTOR for   speech rate.  Speech rate is scaled by this
factor when speaking characters.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set
the global default value, and then set the current local  value to the
result.

   This function is advised.

   Before-advice `emacspeak-auto': Automatically defined advice to
speak interactive prompts.

dtk-set-chunk-separator-syntax	Key Sequence: control e d RETURN
===============================================================

   Interactively set how text is split in chunks.  See the Emacs
documentation on syntax tables for details on how characters are
classified into various syntactic classes.  Argument S specifies the
syntax class.

dtk-set-predefined-speech-rate	Key Sequence: control e d 9   control e d 8   control e d 7   control e d 6   control e d 5   control e d 4   control e d 3   control e d 2   control e d 1   control e d 0
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================

   Set speech rate to one of nine predefined levels.  Interactive
PREFIX arg says to set the rate globally.

dtk-set-pronunciation-mode	Key Sequence: control e d m
======================================================

   Set pronunciation MODE.  This command is valid only for newer
Dectalks, e.g.  the Dectalk Express.  Possible values are `math, name,
europe, spell', all of which can be turned on or off.  Argument STATE
specifies new state.

dtk-set-punctuations	Key Sequence: control e d p
================================================

   Set punctuation mode to MODE.  Possible values are `some', `all', or
`none'.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set   the global default value,
and then set the current local  value to the result.

dtk-set-punctuations-to-all No global keybinding
================================================

   Set punctuation  mode to all.  Interactive PREFIX arg sets
punctuation mode globally.

dtk-set-punctuations-to-some No global keybinding
=================================================

speak interactive prompts.

dtk-stop	Key Sequence: pause   control e s   ESCAPE [  cap P
============================================================

   Stop speech now.

dtk-toggle-allcaps-beep	Key Sequence: control e d  cap C
========================================================

   Toggle allcaps-beep.  when set, allcaps words  are  indicated by a
short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
value, and then set the current local value to the result.  Note that
allcaps-beep is a very useful thing when programming.  However it is
irritating to have it on when reading documents.

dtk-toggle-capitalization	Key Sequence: control e d c
=====================================================

   Toggle capitalization.  when set, capitalization is indicated by a
short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
value, and then set the current local value to the result.

dtk-toggle-debug	Key Sequence: control e d b
============================================

   Toggle state of the debug FLAG.  When debugging is on, you can
switch to the buffer *speaker* to examine the output from the process
that talks to the speech device by using command C-e d M-C-b.  Note:
*speaker* is a hidden buffer, ie it has a leading space in its name.

dtk-toggle-punctuation-mode	Key Sequence: delete
================================================

   Toggle punctuation mode between "some" and "all".  Interactive
PREFIX arg makes the new setting global.

dtk-toggle-quiet	Key Sequence: control e d q
============================================

   Toggle state of the speech device between being quiet and talkative.
Useful if you want to continue using an Emacs session that has
emacspeak loaded but wish to make the speech shut up.  Optional
argument PREFIX specifies whether speech is turned off in the current
buffer o rin all buffers.

dtk-toggle-split-caps	Key Sequence: control e d s
=================================================

   Toggle split caps mode.  Split caps mode is useful when reading
Hungarian notation in program source code.  Interactive PREFIX arg
means toggle the global default value, and then set the current local
value to the result.

dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space	Key Sequence: control e d SPACE
===================================================================

   Toggle splitting of speech on white space.  This affects the
internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split text purely by
clause boundaries, or also include whitespace.  By default, emacspeak
sends a clause at a time to the speech device.  This produces fluent
speech for normal use.  However in modes such as `shell-mode' and some
programming language modes, clause markers appear infrequently, and
this can result in large amounts of text being sent to the speech
device at once, making the system unresponsive when asked to stop
talking.  Splitting on white space makes emacspeak's stop command
responsive.  However, when splitting on white space, the speech sounds
choppy since the synthesizer is getting a word at a time.

dtk-toggle-stop-immediately-while-typing	Key Sequence: control e d  cap I
=========================================================================

   Toggle state of variable `dtk-stop-immediately-while-typing'.  As
the name implies, if T then speech flushes immediately as you type.

emacspeak-realaudio	Key Sequence: control e ;
=============================================

   Start or control streaming audio including MP3 and realaudio.  If
using `TRPlayer' as the player, accepts trplayer control commands if a
stream is already playing.  Otherwise, the playing stream is simply
stopped.  If no stream is playing, this command prompts for a realaudio
resource.  Realaudio resources can be specified either as a Realaudio
URL, the location of a local Realaudio file, or as the name of a local
Realaudio metafile. Realaudio resources you have played in this session
are available in the minibuffer history.  The default is to play the
resource you played most recently. Emacspeak uses the contents of the
directory specified by variable emacspeak-realaudio-shortcuts-directory
to offer a set of completions. Hit space to use this completion list.

   If using TRPlayer, you can either give one-shot commands using
command emacspeak-realaudio available from anywhere on the audio
desktop as C-e ;.  Alternatively,  switch to buffer *realaudo* if you
wish to issue many nvigation commands.  Note that buffer *realaudio*
uses a special major mode that provides the various navigation commands

<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC2">Announcing Emacspeak Manual 2nd Edition As An Open Source Project</A></H1>

<P>
This is to announce the launch of a new open source project
to create a user manual for Emacspeak --an Emacs speech extension that
provides a complete audio desktop.




<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC3">How To Contribute To This Manual</A></H2>

<P>
This manual is organized as a series of chapters, with each chapter in a
separate file.
If you feel capable of contributing to a specific section,
send out a message to the Emacspeak mailing list
<CODE>emacspeak@cs.vassar.edu</CODE>.
You can then start adding content to a local copy of the chapter to
which you are contributing.
When you feel you have something to submit, mail out the file to the
emacspeak mailing list--
I'll integrate new content as it comes in.




<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC4">Authoring Guidelines</A></H2>

<P>
For this manual to hang together and make sense to the new user at whom
it is targetted, contributors need to stick to a consistent style.
If you plan to contribute content, you should take some time to read the
existing sections --note that many of these are skeletal and 
the first contributions will be to flesh these sections out.


<P>
If you are familiar with texinfo, go ahead and mark up your content
using texinfo.
If you are not, simply author the documentation you create as plain
formatted ASCII.
If you do submit files as texinfo source, make sure to validate them at
your end first by running the files through <CODE>makeinfo</CODE> --badly
created or malformed texinfo source takes more time to fix than marking
up straight text.




<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC5">Credits</A></H2>

<P>
This initial version draws heavily from the original Emacspeak user
manual, and includes contributions from 
Jim Van Zandt and Jason White.
Authors who contribute complete sections will be acknowledged here as
well as in the specific section they author.




<H1><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC6">Introduction</A></H1>

<P>
Emacspeak provides a complete audio desktop 
by speech-enabling all of Emacs.


<P>
In the past, screen reading programs have allowed visually impaired
users to get feedback using synthesized speech. Such programs have been
commercially available for well over a decade. Most of them run on PC's
under DOS, and these are now moving over to the Windows environment.
However, screen-readers for the UNIX environment have been conspicuous
in their absence.


<P>
This means that most visually impaired computer users face the
additional handicap of being OS-impaired -- a far more serious
problem:-) 


<P>
Emacspeak is an emacs subsystem that provides complete speech access.
  Emacspeak will always have the shortcoming that it will
only work under Emacs.  This said, there is very little that cannot be
done inside Emacs, so it's not a real shortcoming!


<P>
Emacspeak does have a significant advantage: since it runs inside Emacs, a
structure-sensitive, fully customizable editor, Emacspeak  has more
context-specific information about what it is speaking than its commercial
counterparts.  In this sense, Emacspeak is not a "screenreader", it is a
subsystem that produces speech output.  A traditional screen-reader speaks the
content of the screen, leaving it to the user to interpret the visually
laid-out information.  Emacspeak, on the other hand, treats speech as a
first-class output modality; it speaks the information in a manner that is
easy to comprehend when listening.   


<P>
The basic concepts used by Emacspeak are simple; all interactive Emacs
commands have been adapted to provide speech feedback.  Hence, a user can just
use Emacs as she normally would; Emacspeak works behind the scene to give
audio feedback in addition to updating the screen.


<P>
Emacspeak consists of a core speech system that provides speech and
audio services to the rest of the Emacspeak desktop;
application-specific extensions provide context-specific spoken feedback


<P>
using these services.  Emacspeak currently comes with speech extensions
for several popular Emacs subsystems and editing modes.  I would like to
thank their respective authors for their wonderful work which makes
Emacs more than a text editor<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="emacspeak_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC9">Quick Installation</A></H2>

<P>
Here are the quick installation instructions.
See the next section for detailed installation instructions.



<UL>
<LI>

 Look over the Makefile and edit site-specific variables.
<LI>

 Type <SAMP>`make config'</SAMP> to configure the sources for your site.
<LI>

 Type <SAMP>`make emacspeak'</SAMP> to compile the files.
<LI>

 Run it by doing one of:

<UL>
<LI>

  Start Emacs as follows:

<PRE>
emacs -l &#60;emacspeak-dir&#62;/emacspeak-setup.el -l ~/.emacs
</PRE>

<LI>

Add the line

<PRE>
(load-file "&#60;emacspeak-dir&#62;/emacspeak-setup.el")
</PRE>

to the top of your .emacs file.
<LI>

 Run the shell script emacspeak.sh
found in the directory &#60;emacspeak-dir&#62;
</UL>

In the above, <CODE>&#60;emacspeak-dir&#62;</CODE> refers to the directory where you unpacked
the sources. 
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC10">Configuring and Installing Emacspeak</A></H2>

<P>
Note: You need GNU Emacs 20.2
 or later for using newer versions of Emacspeak.


<P>
The speech server for the Dectalk is written in TclX.  (For example, see the
source file <TT>`dtk-exp'</TT>).  

<UL>
<LI>Decide where you want the Emacspeak elisp files.  Most Unix packages are

unpacked and compiled in one directory, and then the executable,
documentation, and data files are installed in the appropriate system
directories.  

Once you have decided on the appropriate directory, make it if necessary
and unpack the distribution <CODE>.tar</CODE> file there. 

<LI>Look through the introductory section of the Makefile to see if you need

to edit it for your site.
<LI>Check the directory prefix for installation.  The default is <TT>`/usr/local'</TT>,

so <TT>`.info'</TT> files go to <TT>`/usr/local/info'</TT> and the executable
file goes to <TT>`/usr/local/bin'</TT>.  To change this, edit the line
defining <VAR>PREFIX</VAR>.
</UL>

<P>
Configure the source files by typing <SAMP>`make config'</SAMP>.  At this point
you can check that the  speech server is correctly configured by typing

<PRE>
tcl dtk-exp
</PRE>

<P>
(assuming you are using the Dectalk Express).  You should hear the
Dectalk speak and get a TCL prompt if everything is okay.


<P>
If you're feeling paranoid, you can perform a couple of additional tests
at this point. Execute the following commands in the running tcl session
you just started above.  (Most users will not need to do this; it is a
sanity check and is useful in tracking problems, especially if you find
emacspeak beginning to talk and then immediately fall silent.)



<UL>
<LI>


<PRE>
q "this is a test."
d
</PRE>

 You should hear the Dectalk speak  the text.
<LI><SAMP>`s'</SAMP>

 The above command stops speech.
 You should see a TCL prompt when you execute it.
  If things appear to hang when you execute <SAMP>`s'</SAMP>
  i.e. you don't see a TCL prompt

<OL>
<LI>The serial cable conecting your speech device is flaky

<LI>Your serial port is flaky

<LI>The stty settings on the port are incorrect for your system

</OL>

 
In the case of incorrect stty settings please report the problem.  The
following UNIX command can be used to report the stty settings:

<PRE>
stty -a &#60; serial_port
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
Quit this TCL
session by typing control-D.


<P>
Next, compile the elisp files by typing 

<PRE>
make emacspeak
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, install the documentation and executable files by typing 

<PRE>
make PREFIX=&#60;prefix&#62; install 
</PRE>

<P>
The speech server program and/or output port can also be specified at run time by 
setting the shell environment variables <VAR>DTK_PROGRAM</VAR> and <VAR>DTK_PORT</VAR>.
Examples: If using <CODE>csh</CODE> or <CODE>tcsh</CODE> 

<PRE>
setenv DTK_PROGRAM "dtk-exp"
</PRE>

<P>
if using <CODE>sh</CODE> or <CODE>bash</CODE>

<PRE>
DTK_PROGRAM=dtk-exp
export DTK_PROGRAM
</PRE>

<P>
Similarly,

<PRE>
DTK_PORT=/dev/ttyS0
</PRE>

<P>
You can always set these variables from a running Emacs session by
executing
the Emacs setenv command.




<H1><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC11">Basic Usage.</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter gives an overview of how to use Emacspeak.  Note: This
documentation should be used in conjunction with the online Emacs info
pages that extensively document Emacs itself.  These sections briefly
describe the speech-enabling extensions.  However, they should not be
considered a substitute for reading the Emacs manual.  How successfully
you use Emacspeak will depend on how well you learn your Emacs.


<P>
All Emacs navigation and editing commands have been speech enabled. 
Thus, moving to the next or previous word, line or paragraph results in the text
around point being spoken.  Exactly how much text is spoken is determined by
the amount by which you moved.


<P>
In addition, Emacspeak provides  basic reading functions that can be
invoked to listen to chunks of text without moving.




<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC12">Overview of Emacspeak</A></H2>

<P>
Emacspeak provides a small number of core services around which the
remainder of the audio interface is constructed.  These essential
features of the software are briefly outlined in the following
paragraphs; the commands by which they can be controlled will be
described later in the manual.


<P>
Apart from providing a fluent spoken interface to all of Emacs' basic
editing functions, Emacspeak also includes software modules which add
speech feedback to a range of applications that can be run from within
Emacs. In this sense, Emacspeak amounts to much more than a talking
text editor; indeed, it can more aptly be characterized as a true
"audio desktop", in which speech is treated as a first-class output modality.


<P>
Emacspeak implements a special minor mode, known as "voice lock
mode" (see section <A HREF="emacspeak.html#SEC19">Voice Lock Mode</A>) which uses distinct speech characteristics
to provide aural highlighting of specific textual constructs, such as
comments in program code, quoted strings and reserved words. This
facility is further extended when Emacspeak is used with the W3 World
Wide Web browser, to enable the semantic and structural distinctions
captured by the HTML markup to be communicated efficiently.


<P>
It is often desirable to exercise control over the pronunciation of a
word (E.G. a technical term or a reserved word in a programming
language) within specific contexts. Emacspeak maintains pronunciation
dictionaries for this purpose, which may be customized by the
user. Moreover, individual dictionaries can be activated selectively,
depending for example on the current major mode or the name of the
file which is being visited. 


<P>
In addition to spoken feedback, Emacspeak can generate "auditory
icons"---short sound cues which alert the user to significant events,
for example the opening or deletion of a file, the completion of an
action, the arrival of an electronic mail message or the creation of a
completion buffer. Sound cues act as a supplement to the spoken
interface, and are especially valuable to the experienced user in
facilitating rapid interaction. Note that in order to support auditory
icons, the computer must be equipped with sound hardware for which the
operating system has been correctly configured.


<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC13">Working In Emacs Buffers.</A></H2>

<P>
While typing in an Emacs buffer, hitting space  speaks  the recently typed
word.  I use  completion all the time; so Emacspeak will speak the
completion just inserted as well as the next possible completion.
In Emacs, use <CODE>load-library ret completion ret</CODE> for loading
the completion package.  


<P>
The standard Emacs prompting functions have also been speech-enabled.
Emacs prompts with available lists of completions in response to partial
input wherever appropriate --all forms of completion provide speech
feedback.


<P>
In addition, Emacspeak provides a number of commands for reading portions of the current buffer,
getting status information, and modifying Emacspeak's state.


<P>
All of the commands are documented in the subsequent sections.
They can be classified into types:



<UL>
<LI>

 Emacspeak commands for listening to chunks of information.  The names
 of these commands all start with the common prefix
 <CODE>emacspeak-speak-</CODE>.  All Emacspeak commands are bound to the
 keymap <VAR>emacspeak-keymap</VAR> and are accessed with the key
 <KBD>Control e</KBD><A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="emacspeak_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>.  Thus,
 the Emacspeak command <EM>emacspeak-speak-line</EM> is bound to <KBD>l</KBD> in
 keymap <VAR>emacspeak-keymap</VAR> and can be accessed with the keystroke
 <KBD>Control-e l</KBD>.  If for some reason you wish to use some key other
 than <KBD>control-e</KBD> as the common keyboard prefix for all Emacspeak
 commands, set the variable <VAR>emacspeak-prefix</VAR>.
<LI>

 The second category of commands provided by Emacspeak manipulate the state of the speech device.
 The names of these commands start with the common prefix <CODE>dtk-</CODE> and are bound in keymap
<VAR>emacspeak-dtk-submap</VAR>.
 You can access these commands via the prefix <KBD>Control-e d</KBD><A NAME="DOCF3" HREF="emacspeak_foot.html#FOOT3">(3)</A>.
Thus, the command <EM>dtk-set-rate</EM> is bound to <KBD>r</KBD>
 in keymap <VAR>emacspeak-dtk-submap</VAR> and can be executed by
pressing <KBD>Control e d r</KBD>.
</UL>

<P>
Emacs has extensive online help; so does emacspeak. 
 Please use it.


<P>
This info manual is only to get you started.
You can get a summary of Emacspeak's features by pressing <KBD>Control-h Control-e</KBD>




<H2><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC14">Reading Without Moving The Cursor.</A></H2>
<P>
Emacspeak speaks information as you move around within a buffer.  How
much text is spoken depends on how you move, thus, when you move by
words, you hear the current word; when you move by paragraphs, you hear
the current paragraph spoken.  In addition, the following commands allow
you to listen to information without moving point (point is emacs
terminology for the editing cursor).


<P>

called word echo.  Emacspeak can also optionally speak each line as it
is typed --this is called line echo.


<P>
Character, word and line echo can be toggled --either in the current
buffer-- or for all buffers (globally).
To toggle the specific echo functionality for all buffers, precede the
specific command with <KBD>C-u</KBD>.
Note that in the documentation below, this use of <KBD>C-u</KBD> is indicated 
using the common Emacs terminology of <EM>prefix arg</EM> or

<H3><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC17">Setting Various Characteristics Of Speech Output.</A></H3>

<P>
Emacspeak user commands can set different characteristics of the speech
output such as speech rate and  punctuations mode.


<P>
Emacspeak provides a number of settings that affect how  attributes of
the text such as capitalization are conveyed.
These include settings that produce a short tone for each upper case
letter,  as well as a smart mode for speaking mixed case words which is
especially useful when programming.
These settings can be made locally in a given buffer or be applied to
all buffers by preceding these commands with <KBD>C-u</KBD>.

<P>
Speech can be stopped using command <CODE>dtk-stop</CODE>
--though in normal use, 
the action of moving the cursor will stop ongoing speech. Speech can
also be paused and resumed.
The speech server can be stopped and restarted for cases where the user
wants to switch to a different server --or in teh rare case to nuke a

<DD>
dtk-pause
 Pause ongoing speech.
The speech can be resumed with command `dtk-resume'
normally bound to C-e SPC.  Pausing speech is useful when one needs to
perform a few actions before continuing to read a large document.  Emacspeak
gives you speech feedback as usual once speech has been paused.  `dtk-resume'
continues the interrupted speech irrespective of the buffer
in which it is executed.
Optional PREFIX arg flushes any previously paused speech.

dtk-add-cleanup-pattern
 Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that are cleaned up.
Optional interactive prefix arg DELETEs this pattern if
previously added.  Cleaning up repeated patterns results in emacspeak
speaking the pattern followed by a repeat count instead of speaking
all the characters making up the pattern.  Thus, by adding the
repeating pattern `.' (this is already added by default) emacspeak
will say "aw fifteen dot" when speaking the string
"..............." instead of "period period period period ".

dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space
 Toggle splitting of speech on white space.
This affects the internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split
text purely by clause boundaries, or also include
whitespace.  By default, emacspeak sends a clause at a time
to the speech device.  This produces fluent speech for
normal use.  However in modes such as `shell-mode' and some
programming language modes, clause markers appear
infrequently, and this can result in large amounts of text
being sent to the speech device at once, making the system
unresponsive when asked to stop talking.  Splitting on white
space makes emacspeak's stop command responsive.  However,
when splitting on white space, the speech sounds choppy
since the synthesizer is getting a word at a time.

<H2><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC19">Voice Lock Mode</A></H2>

<P>
The status of voice lock mode can be toggled on and off by issuing the
command <KBD>C-e d v (M-x voice-lock-mode)</KBD>. With a prefix arg, this
function applies globally; otherwise, it is local to the current
buffer. To have voice lock mode activated automatically when Emacspeak
starts, include the following code in your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file:



<PRE>
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
'turn-on-voice-lock)
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively, Emacspeak can be set to enable voice lock automatically
in all of the major modes that support it. To do so, insert the
following statement into your Emacs initialization file:



<PRE>
(global-voice-lock-mode t)
</PRE>

<P>
 Note that the list of major modes in which
<CODE>global-voice-lock-mode</CODE> will provide automatic activation is
specified in the variable <VAR>voice-lock-global-modes</VAR>.


<P>
The characteristics of the different voice personalities deployed by
voice lock mode vary according to the capabilities of the speech
synthesizer. The definitions applicable to the Dectalk family of
synthesizers are contained in <TT>`dtk-voices.el'</TT>, which is supplied
as part of the Emacspeak distribution.


<P>
Using voice lock mode, Emacspeak also supports many of the aural style
properties defined in level 2 of the World Wide Web Consortium's
Cascading Style Sheet specification (see
<CODE>http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/</CODE>. Thus, when Emacspeak is running
in conjunction with a cooperating user agent, such as William Perry's
Emacspeak/W3 web browser, the rendering of HTML documents can be
regulated by style sheets. Examples of style rules which employ the
CSS audio properties can be found in the default style sheet which is
supplied in the Emacs/W3 distribution.

<H1><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC21">The Emacspeak Audio Desktop.</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter describes the Emacspeak audio desktop and gives tips and
tricks for making use of many of Emacs' powerful features.


<P>
The desktop is the work area where you organize the tools of
your trade and the information objects relevant to your
current activities.  In the conventional world of visual
GUI-based computing, these tools and information objects
manifest themselves as a collection of icons organized in a
two-dimensional work-area --this organization is designed to
place frequently used objects within easy reach.


<P>
Notice that organizing one's work area in terms of visual
icons arranged in a two-dimensional area where such an
organization is optimized for the available "conversational
gestures" of pointing and clicking is an artifact of visual
interaction.


<P>
In the spirit of a truly speech-enabled application,
Emacspeak does not simply provide you spoken access to a
particular presentation of your work environment that was
initially designed with the "sign language" of visual
interaction in mind. Instead, Emacspeak enables you to work
with documents and other information objects in a manner
that is optimized to aural, eyes-free interaction.  A
necessary consequence of this setup is that users accustomed
to the purely visual manifestation of today's electronic
desktop do not immediately perceive the Emacspeak
environment as an electronic desktop.  This section of the
manual hopes to introduce you to a work-style that encourages a
different perspective on how one interacts with the computer
in performing day-to-day computing tasks.


<P>
The end result in my case has been a marked increase in
personal productivity.




<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC22">Objects Making Up The Emacspeak Desktop</A></H2>

<P>
A "buffer" is the basic building block of the Emacs and
hence the Emacspeak desktop.  Any information presented by
Emacs is placed in a "buffer".  For example, when perusing
this manual within Emacs, the "file" containing the documentation is
presented in a "buffer".  All information objects such as
WWW pages, email messages, output from user interaction with
command-line shells etc., are presented by Emacs in
individual "buffers".


<P>
Buffers provide a base level of user interaction;
Emacs derives its power by allowing applications to
specialize buffers to enable specific types of
user-interaction that is optimized for 
a specific class of information.




<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC23">An Object-Oriented Desktop</A></H2>

<P>
The basic "buffer object" 
can be specialized by Emacs applications to provide optimal
interaction.
This kind of specialization makes the Emacs environment an
object-oriented environment; thus, the basic conversational
gesture of 
"move to the next statement" can be assigned behavior that
is appropriate to the content that the user is currently
navigating.
As an example of such specialization, Emacs provides
"specialized  modes" for working with English text, 
programming languages, markup source e.g. HTML or LaTeX
documents and so on.




<H2><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC24">Emacspeak Specializes Aural Interaction</A></H2>

<P>
The content-specific user interaction described above is a
very powerful feature of Emacs, and this is where Emacspeak
derives its power.  Traditionally, the ability to create
buffers specialized for working with specific content-types
has been used by the Emacs community to develop versatile
programming environments, messaging applications such as
mail and news readers, and authoring environments.  The
clean design present in all of these Emacs extensions in
terms of separating application functionality from the
user-interface, combined with the availability of the entire
source code making up these packages under the open-source
model has laid the ground-work for developing Emacspeak as
a versatile aural counterpart to the product of years of
software engineering that has been invested by the Emacs
community.  In short, Emacspeak would not exist in its
present shape or form without this prior effort.




<H3><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC25">Audio Formatted Output</A></H3>

<P>
Emacspeak takes advantage of the content-specific knowledge
available within specialized buffers to produce "audio
formatted" output designed to optimize user interaction.
A basic consequence of the above is "voice locking" in
specialized modes; a more interesting consequence is the
implementation of Aural Cascading Style Sheets (ACSS) in
conjunction with the Emacs W3 browser.




<H3><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC26">Structured Navigation:</A></H3>

<P>
Emacspeak  also exploits content-specific knowledge to provide
structured navigation of different types of 
electronic content. In many cases, such structured
navigation is an extension of what Emacs provides by
default; in other cases, 
Emacspeak implements the necessary extensions to provide the
level of structural navigation needed to work efficiently in
an eyes-free environment.


<P>
Notable among such structured navigation is Emacs' powerful outline
feature. Notice for example, that the Emacspeak FAQ (reached via command
<CODE>emacspeak-view-emacspeak-faq</CODE> bound to <KBD>C-e F</KBD>) takes
advantage of Emacs' outline mode to allow you to easily move through the
various sections.  An example of content-sensitive navigation is
provided by the imenu package which dynamically creates a "table of
contents" based on the content that is being displayed in a given
buffer.




<H3><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC27">Navigating The Desktop</A></H3>

<P>
In addition to navigating individual information objects,
the Emacspeak environment provides speech-enabled navigation
of the various buffers that are currently open on the
Emacspeak desktop via Emacs' built-in list-buffers feature.
Emacs' dired  --directory editor-- for browsing the file
system, along with the new speedbar package 
that combines features from dired and imenu round off the
suite of navigational tools.




<H3><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC28">Everything Is Searchable:</A></H3>

<P>
Emacs derives one final advantage from using buffers as the basic
building block for the entire desktop.  Every Emacs buffer is searchable
via a uniform and powerful search interface.  Emacs' incremental search
works efficiently and consistently to enable you locate "objects" of
interest either within a given document or to locate a given object from
amongst the various objects that are currently open on the Emacspeak
desktop.  This is <B>very powerful</B> --where a GUI user is typically
limited to quickly locating an object from a relatively small collection
--the size of the collection being a direct function of available
display real-estate-- the Emacspeak user can typically work with a far
larger collection of objects.  This is well-suited to the eyes-free
environment, where display real-estate has no meaning; so bringing up a
list of currently open buffers and performing an incremental search to
locate a specific buffer is just as efficient independent of whether you
have a few dozen or a few hundred buffers open.


<P>
To illustrate the above, my typical working Emacs session
lasts between two and three weeks-- over that time I
typically accumulate several hundred open buffers holding a
large variety of content ranging from program source code to
email messages and WWW pages.


<P>
Ubiquitous search in the eyes-free environment is critical-- as a
comparison, when using a conventional, purely visual WWW browser, users
have no means of easily "searching" for say the "submit" button on a WWW
page.  This inability is a minor annoyance in visual interaction, and
the typical mouse-enabled user <B>never</B> uses the find dialog to find a
submit button-- it is simply more efficient to point at the submit
button given the eye's ability to quickly scan the two-dimensional
display.  This luxury is absent in an eyes-free environment; as a
consequence, blind users confronted by the combination of a visual
interface and screen-reader are typically limited to either tabbing
through all the controls on a WWW page, or using the sub-optimal find
dialog.


<H1><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC29">Using Online Help With Emacspeak.</A></H1>

<P>
Emacs provides an extensive online help system for helping you learn 
about various aspects of using Emacs. Emacspeak provides online help for
its various extensions using this same help system.
This chapter explains how to use the online help facilities in order to
empower you in discovering powerful and versatile working techniques
that will make you more and more productive in your day to day computing.


<P>
The online help options are accessed via the <KBD>C-h</KBD> prefix key,
which must be followed by an additional letter or control character to
designate the kind of help desired.
 For example, <KBD>C-h t</KBD>
<CODE>help-with-tutorial</CODE> visits the Emacs tutorial in a new buffer;
<KBD>C-h i</KBD> <CODE>info</CODE> enters the Info documentation system, from
which you can read Texinfo manuals that have been installed on your
system, including the Emacs and Emacspeak documentation; and <KBD>C-h
k</KBD> <CODE>describe-key</CODE> provides a description of the Emacs function
which is bound to the next key that you type.
For learning about the various  options  that are available via the
<KBD>C-h</KBD> mechanism described above,
view the online help for command <CODE>help-for-help</CODE> 
bound to <KBD>C-h C-h</KBD> --using what has been described so far,
you would achieve this by pressing <KBD>C-h k</KBD> followed by <KBD>C-h
C-h</KBD>.


<P>
Emacspeak users should note that online help is typically displayed in a
separate Emacs window. Where it makes sense to do so, Emacspeak will
automatically speak the displayed help.
Once you've asked for help, you can have the 
displayed documentation as many times as you wish using Emacspeak
command <CODE>emacspeak-speak-help</CODE> bound to <KBD>C-e h</KBD>.
If you want to move through the displayed help a line at a time, switch
to the buffer where the help is displayed --the buffer is called 
<CODE>*Help*</CODE>.


<P>
 Often, in adding an auditory interface to an Emacs extension, such as a
web browser or mail reader, Emacspeak defines additional commands and
key bindings which enhance the functionality of the spoken feedback
provided by the application. This manual does not purport to document
all such commands. It is important, therefore, when learning to use the
various Emacs extensions which comprise the `audio desktop'
(see section <A HREF="emacspeak.html#SEC21">The Emacspeak Audio Desktop.</A>) that you take advantage of online help to obtain
details of any context-specific features provided by Emacspeak.  The
following two commands are of particular importance in this regard:



<UL>
<LI><KBD>C-h m</KBD> <CODE>describe-mode</CODE> explains which

major and minor modes are currently in effect, and lists the commands
and key bindings associated with them.

<LI><KBD>C-h b</KBD>

<CODE>describe-bindings</CODE> lists all of the key bindings which are
currently defined.
</UL>

<P>
The importance of these help functions can be illustrated by the
Emacs/W3 web browser. When point is positioned inside a table, certain
key bindings are established with which you can access Emacspeak
commands that make it possible to read the rows and columns of the
table and explore its structure efficiently. To get a description of these
key bindings, you can use W3 to visit the sample HTML file supplied as
part of the Emacspeak distribution, and, after having moved point onto
the first row of the table, issue the command <KBD>C-h m</KBD>
<CODE>describe-mode</CODE> to create a help buffer containing an explanation
of the features offered by W3 mode.


<P>
Emacspeak supplements the online help facilities available within
Emacs by defining several commands of its own, as follows:



<UL>
<LI><KBD>C-h c-e</KBD> <CODE>describe-emacspeak</CODE> presents a list of

standard Emacspeak commands.

<LI><KBD>C-e F</KBD> <CODE>emacspeak-view-emacspeak-faq</CODE> opens a new

buffer containing the Emacspeak FAQ, a list of frequently asked
questions about Emacspeak together with their answers.

<LI><KBD>C-e C-h</KBD> <CODE>emacspeak-learn-mode</CODE> enters a mode in which

the function of every key that you type is spoken; this mode can be
terminated with the <KBD>C-g</KBD> <CODE>keyboard-quit</CODE> command.

<LI><KBD>M-x emacspeak-generate-documentation</KBD> prompts for the name

of a file in which it saves an automatically generated summary of all
Emacspeak commands.
</UL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC30">Emacs Packages.</A></H1>

<P>
Emacs -- The extensible, self-documenting editor, derives its
functionality from its powerful extension mechnaism. This extension
mechanism is used to implement many user-level applications such as mail
readers, WWW browsers, software development environments and so on.
This chapter gives directions on how to locate the right Emacs package
for addressing specific tasks.  The chapter is organized into logical
sections that each pertain to a specific class of tasks; in dividual
subsections within a section give a brief overview of particular Emacs
packages that have been speech-enabled.




<H2><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC31">Document Authoring</A></H2>

<P>
The Emacspeak environment provides a rich collection of structured
document authoring tools.
These are well-suited for working in an eyes-free environment --you
clearly dont want to use a <B>What You See Is What You Get</B> (WYSIWYG)
authoring tool if you cannot see what you're getting.
 Structure-based authoring tools  allow you to focus on the act of
 content creation, leaving the minutii of visual layout to the computer.




<H3><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC32">Creating Well-formatted Documents</A></H3>

<P>
Before authoring a document, decide its primary audience 
if the document contains relatively simple content e.g., no mathematical
equations etc. 
and is primarily targetted at the WWW,  you are probably better off
using HTML.
You can create well-structured HTML documents with the help of package 
<CODE>html-helper-mode</CODE> available from 
<CODE>ftp://ftp.reed.edu/pub/src/html-helper-mode.tar.gz</CODE>.
Package <CODE>html-helper-mode</CODE> is speech-enabled by Emacspeak to
provide auditory icons, structured navigation and outlines, as well as
voice locking for audio formatted feedback as you work.


<P>
If the document being authored is more complex, you are usually better
off creating it in LaTeX.
Note that LaTeX documents can be converted to HTML either via package
<CODE>tth</CODE> or package <CODE>latex2html</CODE> --both available on the WWW.


<P>
The TeX family of typesetting languages  is suitable for producing 
well-formatted documents in an eyes-free environment.
Unlike WYSIWYG environments, 
the author  of a TeX or LaTeX document works with the content of the
document, leaving it to the formatting system (TeX) 
to format the document for good visual presentation.


<P>
The auctex package is an Emacs extension that facilitates authoring and
maintaining structured documents in TeX and LaTeX.  Package
<CODE>bibtex</CODE> facilitates maintainance and use of <CODE>bibtex</CODE>
bibliography databases.  The Texinfo package allows creation of software
documentation that is suitable for both printing as well as online
viewing as hypertext.  Emacspeak speech-enables packages <CODE>auctex</CODE>,
<CODE>bibtex</CODE> and <CODE>texinfo</CODE> to provide convenient spoken feedback
as you create and compile documents. For details on using these
packages, see their accompanying online info documentation.  


<P>
The most recent version of package <CODE>auctex</CODE> is always available by
ftp at <CODE>ftp://ftp.iesd.auc.dk/pub/emacs-lisp/auctex.tar.gz</CODE>.
Packages <CODE>bibtex</CODE> and  <CODE>texinfo</CODE> are part of the standard Emacs distribution.


<P>
As the document preparation system of choice, Emacspeak supports a
fluent speech-enabled interface
to editing and formatting LaTeX documents.
This interface is provided
by speech-enabling  <EM>auctex</EM> mode. 


<P>
Mode <EM>auctex</EM> provides efficient keyboard shortcuts for
inserting and maintaining LaTeX markup as a document is being
authored.
All of these editing commands provide succinct auditory
feedback when used with Emacspeak.
The syntax coloring provided by this mode is extended to provide <EM>
  voice locking</EM>
--- consequently, Emacspeak uses different voices to speak the
embedded markup to set it apart from the content.


<P>
Mode <EM>auctex</EM> can be used to create empty document templates and
to insert document content
at the appropriate places in the template.
The mode also enables structured 
navigation of the document as it is
being edited.  Emacspeak speech-enables these template creation and
structured navigation commands to produce auditory icons and succinct
spoken feedback.  For example, while editing, the user can quickly
browse through the sections of the document and have each section
title spoken.  Document elements such as paragraphs and bulleted lists
can be manipulated as logical units.  These features are especially
relevant  in an eyes-free environment where the user needs to select
logical parts of the document without having to point at portions of a
visual display.


<P>
Finally, Emacs supports creating and maintaining SGML and XML documents.
Emacs comes with a fairly simple <CODE>sgml-mode</CODE>
--in addition, package <CODE>psgml</CODE> provides sophisticated parsing and
validation facilities for working with SGML and XML documents.
Package <CODE>psgml</CODE> can be downloaded from
<CODE>http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/public/COMP/info/psgml/psgml_toc.html</CODE>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC33">Searching, Replacing, And Spell Checking</A></H3>

<P>
Incremental search, a process by which the system prompts the user for a
search string and moves the selection to the next available match while
allowing the user to add more characters to the search string, is the
search technique of choice amongst most Emacs users.  As the system
successively finds each match and provides the user the option of
continuing the search.  Incremental search is a more complex instance of
traditional search interaction because in addition to either stopping or
continuing the search, the user can modify the current search in a
number of ways including specifying a longer (or shorter)
search string.


<P>
All of the user commands available during incremental search are
documented in the online Emacs info manual.  These are speech-enabled by
Emacspeak to provide spoken prompts as the dialogue begins; auditory
icons indicate a search hit or search miss as the search progresses.
Along with auditory icons <EM>search-hit</EM> and <EM>search-miss</EM> the
user also hears the current line spoken, and in the case of a search
hit, the matching text is <EM>aurally</EM> highlighted by using the
standard audio formatting technique of changing voice characteristic.
This feedback proves extremely effective when the search pattern appears
several times on a single line; the user is unambiguously cued to the
current match.


<P>
Search and replace actions are an extension to the basic
conversational gestures of  a search dialogue.
In addition to specifying a search string,
the user also specifies a replacement string.
On the Emacspeak desktop, this functionality is provided by
command <EM>query-replace</EM>.  The
speech-enabled version of this interaction prompts the user for the
search and replacement texts.  The 
auditory feedback during the interactive search and replacement
process parallels that described in the case of incremental search.
Audio formatting to indicate the occurrence that is about to be
replaced proves an effective means of avoiding erroneous modifications
to the text being edited.  As an example, consider using command <EM>
  query-replace</EM> to locate and replace the second occurrence of 
  <B>foo</B> with <B>bar</B> in the text
 
   <SAMP>`Do not change this fool, but change this food.'</SAMP>
 
  When the search matches the first occurrence of <B>foo</B>
 in word <EM>fool</EM>, the aural highlighting helps the user in
 answering "no" in response to question "should this occurrence be
 replaced".  In addition to allowing the user to supply a
 simple "yes or no" answer for each match, command <EM>
   query-replace</EM> also allows the user to specify a number of other
 valid answers as described  in the online Emacs documentation.




<H1><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC34">Spell Checking</A></H1>

<P>
A more complex instance of conversational gesture "search and
replace" is exhibited by standard spell checking dialogues.  Spell
checking differs from the search and replace dialogue described above
in that the search and replacement text is guessed by the system based
on an available dictionary.  Words that are not found in the
dictionary are flagged as potential spelling errors, and the system
offers an interactive search and replace dialogue for each of these
possible errors.  During this dialogue, the system successively selects
each occurrence of the possibly erroneous word and offers a set of
possible replacements.  Unlike in the case of simple search and
replace, more than one possible replacement string is offered, since a
potential spelling error can be corrected by more than one word
appearing in the dictionary.


<P>
In the visual interface, such spell checking dialogues are realized by
displaying the available choices in a pop-up window
and allowing the user to pick a correction
Once a correction is selected, the user is offered the choice of
interactively  replacing the erroneous word with the correction.


<P>
The spell checking interface on the Emacspeak desktop is speech-enabled
to provide fluent auditory feedback.  The visual interface parallels
that described above and is provided by package <CODE>ispell</CODE> which is
part of the standard Emacs distribution.  Emacspeak provides a spoken 
prompt that is composed of the line
containing the possibly erroneous word (which is aurally highlighted to
set it apart from the rest of the text on that line) and the available
corrections.  Each correction is prefixed with a number that the user
can use to select it.  Once a correction is selected, the interaction
continues with the query and replace interaction described earlier.  The
speech interface to the spell checker is as fluent as the visual
interface.  Notice that Emacspeak users do not need to concern
themselves with the details of the visual display such as "the
corrections are displayed in a window at the top of the screen".


<P>
In addition to the standard spell checker described above, newer
versions of Emacs include an "on-the-fly" spell checker that flags
erroneous words as they are typed.
Emacspeak speech-enables package <CODE>flyspell</CODE> so that such erroneous
words are aurally highlighted.


<H2><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC35">Structured Editing And Templates</A></H2>

<P>
Editing documents based on the inherent 
structure present in the electronic
encoding can be very efficient when using spoken interaction.  We described
mode <EM> auctex</EM> -- a specialized interface to authoring LaTeX
documents as a special instance of such structured editing
in see section <A HREF="emacspeak.html#SEC31">Document Authoring</A>.


<P>
The Emacspeak desktop allows the user to efficiently author and
maintain an electronic document based either on the 
structure present in the
markup (as in the case of mode auctex) or on special outlining
constructs that allow the user to impose a desired logical structure
on the document.  This section describes the effect of speech-enabling
such editing tools and points out the advantages in using these in a
speech oriented interface.


<P>
Template-based authoring -- a technique that allows the user to create
a document by inserting contents into appropriate positions in a
predefined template-- goes hand in hand with such structured editing.
Finally, structured editing can vastly simplify the creation and
maintenance of structured data, for example, the data present in a UNIX
password file.  Such data files are in fact nothing more than a
collection of database records, where each record (or line) consists of
a set of fields delimited by a special character.  Maintaining such
files without exploiting the underlying structure often tends to be
error prone.  We describe editing modes that can exploit such record
structure to provide a fluent editing interface.  Finally, we outline a
speech-enabled interface to a spreadsheet application as a complex
instance of such structured data editing.




<H3><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC36">Outline Editing</A></H3>

<P>
All of the various outline editing interfaces on the Emacs desktop
allow the user to <EM> hide</EM> or <EM> show</EM>
the contents at the different levels of a possibly nested tree
structure.
   Components of this tree structure can be
manipulated as a unit, e.g.,
entire subtrees can be deleted or copied.
Outline editing thus provides an efficient means of obtaining quick
overviews of a document.


<P>
The visual interface displays such hidden content as a series of
ellipses following the visible outline heading.  Emacspeak produces
auditory icon <EM> ellipses</EM> when 
speaking such outline headings.


<P>
The basic <EM> outline mode</EM> allows the user to specify the syntax
and level of outline header lines as a regular expression.  This
simple technique can be used to advantage in the structured navigation
of large electronic texts such as those available on the Internet from
online book projects such as project Gutenberg and the Internet
Wiretap.  For example, when this feature is activated while reading
the electronic text of a Shakespearean play, the different acts can be
recognized as separate nodes in the logical structure of the document.
The user can then hide the document body with a single keystroke,
navigate the outline headings to find a particular act, and have that
portion rendered either visually or aurally.  Hiding an outline level
produces auditory icon <EM> close-object</EM>; exposing a hidden level
produces auditory icon <EM> open-object</EM>.  
For details on using mode <CODE>outline</CODE>, see the relevant section of
the online Emacs info manual.


<P>
The basic outline facility described above is applicable to all
content being edited or browsed on the Emacspeak desktop.  In
addition, Emacspeak has  other specialized outline editing
modes such as  <EM> folding mode</EM> that provide extended
outlining facilities.  In mode
<EM> folding</EM>, the user can create
(possibly nested) <EM> folds</EM> -- logical containers of content
that are delimited by a special <EM> fold mark</EM>.  The fold mark is
typically a text string that is chosen based on the type of content
that is being manipulated.  Thus, when <EM> folding</EM> a C~program
source file, fold marks are created from C~comments.  The user can
<EM> open</EM> or <EM> close</EM> any or all folds in a document, and
these actions
are accompanied by auditory icons <EM> open-object</EM>
and <EM> close-object</EM>.  By entering a fold, all editing actions are
restricted to the contents of that fold; this proves a simple yet
convenient way of constraining editing actions such as search and
replace to specific portions of large documents.
Folds can be manipulated as a unit and can be deleted, copied or moved.


<P>
Mode <EM> folding</EM> proves especially effective in maintaining large
software modules.  The technique can be used to advantage by creating
folds for different sections in a module and by further placing each
function appearing in a particular %
section in a fold of its
own.  Complex functions can themselves be folded into sections where
each section reflects a different stage in the algorithm implemented
by that function.  Thus, the technique of folding can be used as an
effective aid in <EM> literate</EM> programming.  I typically write
software modules by first creating an outline structure using folds
that reflect the various components of that module. Next, I populate
each fold with the function signatures and documentation for the
functions in each section.  When I am satisfied with the overall
architecture of the module, I fill in the function skeletons with
actual program code.  This technique is used extensively in
maintaining  the  Emacspeak code base.  




<H3><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC37">Template-based Authoring</A></H3>

<P>
Emacspeak supports two powerful template-based authoring subsystems that
enable the user to quickly create and fill in templates.  <EM> Dmacro</EM>
(short for "dynamic macros") allows the user to define and invoke
template-based macros that are specialized for creating different types
of content.  For example, when programming in C, the user can invoke
dynamic macros that insert skeletons of standard C constructs with a few
keystrokes.  This form of editing has numerous advantages in creating
consistently structured code when developing large software modules.
Emacspeak speech-enables mode <EM> dmacro</EM> to provide succinct spoken
feedback as templates are created and filled.  The user invokes <EM>
dmacro</EM> via command <EM> insert dmacro</EM>, which is typically bound to a
single key.  This results in a dialogue where the user is prompted to
pick one of the dynamic macros available in the current context.  If the
users choice can be uniquely completed, that completion is spoken;
otherwise, the list of possible completions based on the available
partial input is spoken, accompanied by auditory icon <EM> help</EM>.


<P>
An alternative template-editing facility is provided by mode  <EM> tempo</EM>
This mode is designed to  be used in creating
template-based editing tools for specific markup languages; a good
example is mode <EM> html-helper</EM>,
a  mode for creating and updating HTML documents for
publishing on the WWW (see see section <A HREF="emacspeak.html#SEC31">Document Authoring</A>).




<H3><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC38">Maintaining Structured Data</A></H3>

<P>
Consider the following entry from file <CODE> /etc/passwd</CODE>
on my laptop.


<P>
<SAMP>`aster:KlZVoUxwQQBT2:501:100:Aster Labrador:/home/aster:/bin/bash'</SAMP>


<P>
 File <CODE> /etc/passwd</CODE> is a simple instance of a text file
that stores structured data records as a series of fields delimited by
a special character. Each item in the file acquires <EM>
  meaning</EM> from the <EM> position</EM>  in which it  occurs   for
example, the fifth field contains the <B> user name</B>, Aster Labrador.
More generally, structured data where each field in a record has <EM>
  meaning</EM> is found throughout the desktop in applications ranging
from entries in a rolodex to rows in a spreadsheet.


<P>
Typically, users do not directly edit the stored representation of the
data. Instead, application front-ends provide a more human-centric
(and hopefully less error prone) user interface for modifying and
maintaining the data.  Thus, spreadsheet applications present the
data as a two dimensional table that is automatically updated to
reflect changes in the underlying data.  The two dimensional table is
perhaps the most commonly found visual front-end to structured data
  tables with row and column headers prove a succinct
way of implicitly displaying the <EM> meaning</EM> along with the <EM>
  value</EM> of the fields making up each data record.


<H2><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC39">Browsing Structured Information</A></H2>

<P>
This section describes packages that allow you to browse structured
information  --these are distinct from the 
tools described in section <A HREF="emacspeak.html#SEC35">Structured Editing And Templates</A>,
 in that they are typically
used for working with  content that is read-only e.g., online
documentation.




<H2><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC40">Electronic Messaging Applications</A></H2>

<P>
Working with messaging applications involves both authoring and browsing
content.
Emacspeak provides a rich set of speech-enabled messaging tools.
Further, all of the tools described in the previous sections 
integrate smoothly with the messaging applications described here; this
means that you do not need to re-learn a new set of 
work habits when dealing with content in your messaging application.




<H2><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC41">Editting Program Source Code</A></H2>

<P>
Files containing program source code form a very specific class of
<B>structured</B> documents.
Unlike documents meant for human consumption that are often only loosely
structured, program source 
(as a concession to the computer's intolerance of lack of structure)
are per force well-structured and adhere to a fairly stringent  syntax. 


<P>
The Emacs environment provides editting modes that are specific to
creating and maintaining software written in 
most popular programming languages. Many of these editting modes are
speech-enabled by Emacspeak.
Speech-enabling these modes includes providing 
a rich set of navigational  commands that allow you to move 
through the source efficiently. In addition, Emacspeak's core
<B>voice-lock</B> facilities are used to produce audio formatted output 
--this helps you spot errors quickly.




<H2><A NAME="SEC42" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC42">Software Development Environment</A></H2>

<P>
In addition to providing specialized editting modes for creating and
maintaining program source,
Emacs provides a rich set of software development tools that can be
combined to create powerful Integrated Development Environments (IDE).
These IDEs are speech-enabled by Emacspeak to provide a versatile and
powerful  environment for eyes-free software development.




<H2><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC43">Desktop Management</A></H2>

<P>
Emacs provides an integrated environment for performing all of ones
day-to-day computing tasks ranging from electronic messaging to software
development.
The environment derives its power from the fact that 
this integration allows for content to be handled across different tasks
in a seamless manner. 
In order to work effectively with large Emacs sessions with many
documents and applications open at the same time, the Emacspeak desktop
provides 
a powerful collection of desktop management tools designed to help the
user easily locate objects that pertain to a given task.




<H2><A NAME="SEC44" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC44">Personal Information Management</A></H2>
<P>
This section describes speech-enabled tools designed to aid in personal
information management such as maintaining a daily calendar.




<H2><A NAME="SEC45" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC45">Desktop Applications</A></H2>



<H3><A NAME="SEC46" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC46">Spread Sheets</A></H3>

<P>
Spreadsheet applications present a two dimensional view of structured data
where the field values are (possibly) mutually dependent.  On the Emacspeak
desktop, a speech-enabled spreadsheet application can be used to manipulate
such data-driven documents%
ranging from simple cheque books and expense
reports to  complex investment portfolios.  Where the traditional visual
interface to spreadsheets is typically independent of the semantics of the
data stored in the spreadsheet, the speech-enabled interface is derived from
the <EM> meaning</EM> of the various fields making up the data.   When presenting such
information on a  visual display, implicit visual
layout can be used to cue the user to the meaning of different data fields.
On the other hand, in the case of an actively scrolling auditory display, the
spoken output needs to explicitly convey both the value and interpretation of
the different data items.  In addition, the interface needs to enable an
active dialogue between user and application where the user is able to query
the system about the possible meaning of a particular item of data.  Finally,
the aural interface needs to enable <EM> multiple</EM> views of the display.
In the visual interface, such <EM> multiple</EM> views are automatically
enabled by the two dimensional layout combined with the eye's ability to move
rapidly around the layout structure.  Thus, while viewing any particular row
of a portfolio, one can immediately see the current total value as well as
the net gain or loss.
The Emacs spread-sheet package <CODE>dismal</CODE> can be retrieved from
 <CODE>ftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/local/fox/dismal</CODE>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC47" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC47">Forms Mode</A></H3>

<P>
<EM> Forms</EM> mode  an Emacs mode designed to edit structured data
records like the line shown from file <CODE> /etc/passwd</CODE> presents a
user-friendly visual interface that displays the field name along with the field
value.  The user can edit the field value and save the file, at which point
the data is written out using the underlying <CODE> :</CODE> delimited
representation.  Mode <EM> forms</EM> provides a flexible interface to
associating meaning to the fields of such structured data files.  
For details on it use, see the forms-mode section of the online Emacs
info documentation.




<H3><A NAME="SEC48" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC48">OCR --Reading Print Documents</A></H3>
<P>
Module <EM>emacspeak-ocr</EM>
implements 
an OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.  


<P>
Page image is acquired using tools from package <EM>SANE</EM> (Scanner
Access Now Easy).  The acquired image is run through the OCR engine if
one is available, and the results placed in a buffer that is suitable
for browsing the results. This buffer is placed in mode
<EM>emacspeak-ocr-mode</EM>
a specialized mode for reading and scanning documents.




<H4><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC49">Emacspeak OCR Mode</A></H4>

<P>
Emacspeak OCR mode is a special major  mode for document scanning and  OCR.
 
 


<P>
Pre-requisites:



<UL>

<LI>A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

<LI>An OCR engine.

</UL>

<P>
 Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have the utilities
to scan a document and acquire an image as a tiff file.  Then set
variable <VAR>emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program</VAR> to point at this
utility.  By default, this is set to `scanimage' which is the image
scanning utility provided by SANE.


<P>
By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired
tiff image; make sure you have a utility like <CODE>tiffcp</CODE>.
Variable <VAR>emacspeak-ocr-compress-image</VAR> is set to `tiffcp' by
default; if you use something else, you should customize
this variable.


<P>
Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and working.  By
default this front-end assumes that OCR is available as <CODE>/usr/bin/ocr</CODE>.


<P>
Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying
OCR to it work independently of Emacs, you can use this
Emacspeak front-end to enable easy OCR access from within
Emacspeak.


<P>
The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command emacspeak-ocr bound
to <KBD>C-e C-o</KBD>.


<P>
This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR
commands bounds to single keystrokes-- see the ke-binding
list at the end of this description.  Use Emacs online help
facility to look up help on these commands.


<P>
emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to
scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned
images and the resulting text are saved under directory
<CODE>~/ocr</CODE>; see variable <VAR>emacspeak-ocr-working-directory</VAR>.
Invoking command emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound
to <KBD>d</KBD> will open this directory.


<P>
By default, the document being scanned is named `untitled'.
You can name the document by using command
emacspeak-ocr-name-document bound to
<KBD>n</KBD>.  The document name is used
in constructing the name of the image and text files.


<P>
Here is a list of all emacspeak OCR commands along with their
key-bindings and a brief description:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD><KBD>digit</KBD></KBD>
<DD>
               <EM>emacspeak-ocr-page</EM>
Jumps to specified page in the OCR output.

<DT><KBD><KBD>c</KBD></KBD>
<DD>
               <EM>emacspeak-ocr-set-compress-image-options</EM>

<H1><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC50">Running Terminal Based Applications</A></H1>

<P>
You can use the terminal emulator mode to run arbitrary terminal-based
programs from within Emacs.  You open a terminal emulator buffer using
M-x term, with an extra carriage return to accept the default shell
(such as bash).  (Incidently, don't confuse this command with M-x
terminal-emulator, which starts an older terminal emulator mode not
supported by Emacspeak.)


<P>
Three kinds of commands are used within the terminal emulator.
Normal term commands use a prefix of C-c.  The emacspeak commands for
eterm mode use a prefix of C-t.  Anything else is a normal shell command.


<P>
There are two sub-modes of term mode: char sub-mode and line sub-mode.
In char sub-mode, emacspeak will only speak the final chunk of output
--typically the last line displayed.
Each character typed (except `term-escape-char`) is sent immediately.
Use char sub-mode for screen oriented programs like vi or pine.  


<P>
In line sub-mode, program output is spoken if user option
 <CODE>eterm-autospeak</CODE> is turned on.  When you type a return at the end
 of the buffer, that line is sent as input, while return not at end
 copies the rest of the line to the end and sends it.
When using terminal line mode with option <CODE>eterm-autospeak</CODE> turned
 on, 
speech feedback is similar to that obtained in regular <CODE>shell-mode</CODE>
 buffers.


<P>
The default is char sub-mode.  You can switch to line sub-mode with C-c
C-j (recall that control J is a linefeed), and back to char sub-mode
with C-c C-k (think of character spelled with a K).


<P>
Note:  Use char-mode with the terminal emulator for running
screen-oriented programs like Lynx or Pine.
For regular shell interaction just use M-x shell 
instead of using the terminal emulator.




<H2><A NAME="SEC51" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC51">Char Sub-mode of Term Mode</A></H2>

<P>
In char sub-mode of term, each character you type is sent directly to
the inferior process without intervention from emacs, except for the
escape character (usually C-c).


<P>
Here are some of the useful commands for the char sub-mode.  Note that
the usual commands for killing a buffer or switching buffers do not work
in this mode, so new key bindings are supplied.  The first five commands
are different ways of leaving this mode.

A prefix argument serves as a repeat count.  Zero means repeat until
error.
</DL>

<P>
You can get a list of all the key sequences with a C-c prefix by typing
C-c C-h while in this sub-mode.  Some of those commands are only available
in the char sub-mode, while others are generally available.




<H2><A NAME="SEC52" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC52">Line Sub-mode of Term Mode</A></H2>

<P>
In line sub-mode of term mode, emacs editing commands work normally,
until you type RET which sends the current line to the inferior process.


<P>
Here are some of the useful commands for the line sub-mode of the term
mode.  In addition, the usual commands for handling a buffer work in
this mode (C-x o to switch windows, C-x k to kill a buffer, C-x f to
find a file, and so forth).

<DT><SAMP>`M-x term-stop-subjob'</SAMP>
<DD>
Stop the current subjob.  Resume the subjob in the foreground with the
ordinary command fg, or run it in the background with bg.  WARNING: if
there is no current subjob, you can end up suspending the top-level
process running in the buffer. If you accidentally do this, use M-x
term-continue-subjob to resume the process. (This is not a problem with
with most shells, including bash, since they ignore this signal.)

</DL>

<P>
You can get a list of all the key sequences with a C-c prefix by typing
C-c C-h while in this sub-mode.  Some of those commands are only available
in the line sub-mode, while others are generally available.




<H2><A NAME="SEC53" HREF="emacspeak_toc.html#TOC53">Eterm Mode Commands</A></H2>

<P>
The eterm mode maintains a pointer, which is not necessarily the same as
the terminal's cursor.  It is intended to be used in eterm's char
submode.  In char submode, C-t , (that's control-t followed by comma)
will tell you where the eterm pointer is.  C-t C-i will tell you where
the terminal's cursor is.  The top left corner of the window is "row 0
column 0".


<P>
The eterm pointer can be moved with C-t &#60; (to the top of the screen),
C-t &#62; (to the bottom of the screen), C-t n (to the next line), C-t p (to
the previous line), and C-t . (to the cursor).  Each of these also
speaks the line the pointer moves to.  You can also search forward with
C-t s.  


<P>
These commands speak without moving the pointer: C-t l (current line),
C-t w (current word), C-t c (current character), and C-t [space] (from
eterm pointer to cursor).


<P>
You may enter review mode with C-t q.  In review mode, you can search
the buffer and speak its contents, without disturbing the terminal.
Commands for moving the pointer are similar to normal editing commands,
but without a control key: n and p for next and previous line, f and b
for forward and back by characters, &#60; and &#62; for the beginning or end of
the buffer.  c, w, and l speak the current character, word, and line.  s
searches forward (not incrementally).  A comma speaks the pointer
location.  A period moves the pointer to the terminal cursor.  Return to
normal term mode by typing q.

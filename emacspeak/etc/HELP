emacspeak is an interactive Lisp function in `/home/raman/emacs/lisp/emacspeak/lisp/emacspeak.el'.
(emacspeak)

Starts the Emacspeak speech subsystem.  Use emacs as you
normally would, emacspeak will provide you spoken feedback
as you work.  Emacspeak also provides commands for having
parts of the current buffer, the mode-line etc to be spoken.

If you are hearing this description as a result of pressing
C-h C-e you may want to press
C-e s to stop speech, and then use the arrow keys to
move around in the Help buffer to read the rest of this
description, which includes a summary of all emacspeak
keybindings.

All emacspeak commands use C-e as a
prefix key.  You can also set the state of the TTS engine  by
using C-e d as a prefix.  Here is
a summary of all emacspeak commands along with their
bindings.  You need to precede the keystrokes listed below
with C-e.

Emacspeak also provides a fluent speech extension to the
emacs terminal emulator (eterm).  Note: You need to use the
term package that comes with emacs-19.29 and later.

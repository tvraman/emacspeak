Notes On Using IBM ViaVoice Outloud (Software TTS) with Emacspeak:

IBM ViaVoice TTS (Text To Speech) formerly known as IBM
ViaVoice Outloud is a text to speech synthesis engine that
allows you to produce synthetic speech from text using a
sound card. Note that ViaVoice TTS is no longer available on the Internet.

* Pre-requisites:

You need to obtain  and install the IBM ViaVoice TTS
(previously called Outloud) engine.  The The ViaVoice TTS  engine
itself is not distributed as part of this package --see 
http://www.redhat.com/services/techsupport/accessibility/s1-access-install.html



You should only need to install the RTK (runtime toolkit).


The Outloud speech server uses midi for producing auditory
icons.  You need to obtain and install package stdiosynth
from http://www.leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/stdiom.tar.gz
Note that that package comes pre-built --to compile it
yourself you need the commercial OSS installation;
however you do not need the commercial OSS package to use
the pre-built binary.

(Hackers note: I'm looking for a stdiosynth replacement,
if you have the cycles to work on this it will be much
appreciated.)

 * Installation:

** Is Outloud Working?

Once you have successfully obtained and install IBM ViaVoice
Outloud for Linux (RTK and SDK), first verify that the
synthesis engine works by running the sample programs that
come with that package.  Note that the sample programs only
come with the SDK.
If you choose to only install the RTK  (Run Time Kit)
and run into trouble, you'll need the SDK to troubleshoot
your problem.


If you have only installed the RTK,
try starting the ViaVoice speech server by typing 

bash $ tcl
/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/servers/outloud 
at the shell prompt.

Only after verifying that the TTS engine works and that you
hear the speech output should you proceed to installing the
Emacspeak Outloud support.

**  Have You Installed Emacspeak?

Before attempting to build and install ViaVoice Outloud
support for Emacspeak you should first install Emacspeak the
normal way.  See the Emacspeak Makefile for instructions.

** Compiling Outloud Support For Emacspeak:

You need not do this step with Emacspeak 15.0 and later.

Change to the linux-outloud subdirectory 
of the Emacspeak source distribution.
   make 
This should compile the Emacspeak Outloud TCL library to
produce a file called tcleci.so.
Note that you need to have the SDK installed to execute this
step successfully.

* Testing:

Next, test that your installation of the Emacspeak Outloud
support works.  The ViaVoice Outloud speech server is called
outloud and is installed in the emacspeak directory along
with other speech servers.

To test this server, do:
   tcl <full path to outloud>
This should speak a welcome message and display a tcl>
   prompt
if all is well.
   
* Using Outloud With Emacspeak:

Proceed to this step *only*
after successfully completing all of the previous steps.
You can either make the Outloud engine your default
synthesizer by setting environment variable 
DTK_PROGRAM as follows befoer launching Emacs:
export DTK_PROGRAM=outloud

Alternatively,  you can switch to the Outloud engine while
emacspeak is running by 
invoking command dtk-select-server --type
C-e d d ret outloud ret 


* Using outloud as the default synthesizer:

Once you've confirmed that everything is working with the
Outloud engine and Emacspeak, you can make outloud your
default synthesizer by:

** If you start emacspeak by typing emacspeak:

   Supply the -o command-line option i.e. 
start emacspeak as 
emacspeak -o

** If you have emacspeak launched from inside your .emacs:

set variable dtk-program to "outloud" 
before you load emacspeak-setup.el


* Missing Features:

The following standard emacspeak features are not yet supported:

*** All caps beep 

*** Capitalization beep

* Known Problems:

**  Outloud server dies sporadically:


*** Avoid Character echo if possible

There is a known problem with the ViaVoice Outloud engine on
Linux with certain sound cards when stopping and starting speech in rapid succession.
When using Emacspeak, this bug manifests itself as the speech
server sporadically dying.

In my own use, I've found the Outloud server to be mostly
usable with character echo turned off.  However, expect to
have to restart the server at times by hitting C-e C-s until
this bug in the Linux soundcard support goes away.

*** Sound Device Should be Free:

If you have other programs using the sound device, the
Outloud engine will not work.
If you use the Outloud engine for your primary TTS,
you will not get any speech feedback if you play realaudio
or use other programs that open and hold the wave device
--unless you are using a new soundcard like the SBLive
capable of playing multiple streams of audio.

Alternatively, get a sound card like the Soundblaster SBLive
 capable of mixing multiple channels of audio.

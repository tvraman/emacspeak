#Copyright (C) 1995 -- 2003, T. V. Raman 
# {{{  documentation

# Running TTS server remotely.
#Note that on modern  Linux installations,
#You will need to:
#Create  file .ssh/environment 
# in your home directory on the local machine,
# Set ECIINI in that file like so:
#ECIINI=<dirname>
#and finally, update /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
#to set PermitUserEnvironment to yes
#In addition, you may need to ssh once by hand to get past the 
#"do you want to continue connecting" question.

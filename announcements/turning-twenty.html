<p>
One afternoon in  the third week of September 1994, 
I started writing myself a small Emacs extension using Lisp
Advice to make Emacs speak to me so I could use a Linux laptop. 
As Emacspeak turns twenty, this article is both a quick look back
over the twenty years of lessons learned, as well as a  glimpse
into what might be possible as we evolve to a  world of
connected, ubiquitous computing.

<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> The Beginning: Using UNIX With Speech Output In 1994</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
As a graduate student at <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/raman/raman.html">Cornell</a>,  I accessed my Unix workstation
(SunOS) from a 486 PC running IBM Screenreader.  There was no
means of directly using a UNIX box at the time; after graduating,
I continued doing the same for about six months at Digital
Research in Cambridge   —   the only difference being that my
desktop workstation was now a DEC-Alpha. Throughout this time,
Emacs was my environment of choice for everything from software
development and Internet access to writing documents.
</p>


<p>
In fall of 1994, I wanted to start using a laptop running Linux;
a colleague (Dave Wecker) was retiring his 386mhz laptop that
already had Linux on it and I decided to inherit it. But there
was only one problem   —   until then I had always accessed a UNIX
machine from a secondary PC running a screenreader   —   something
that would clearly make no sense with a laptop!
</p>

<p>
A few weeks earlier, another colleague Win Treese, had pointed
out the interesting possibilities presented by package <i>Advice</i>
 in Emacs 19.23   —   he had sent around a
small snippet of code that magically modified Emacs'
version-control primitive to first create an <i>RCS</i> directory if
none existed before adding a file to version control. When I
speculated about using the Linux laptop, Dave remarked   —   you
live in Emacs anyway   —   why dont you just make it talk!
</p>

<p>
Connecting the dots, I decided to write myself a tool that
augmented Emacs' default behaviour to <i>speak</i>   —   within about 4
hours, version 0.01 of Emacspeak was up and running.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Key Enabler: Emacs And Lisp Advice</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
It took me a couple of weeks to fully recognize the potential of
what I had built with Emacs Lisp Advice. Until then, I had used
screen-readers to listen to the contents of the visual display
  —   but Lisp Advice let me do a lot more   —   it enabled Emacspeak
to generate highly context-specific spoken feedback, augmented by
a set of auditory icons. I later formalized this design under the
name <i>Speech-Enabled Applications</i>. For a detailed overview of the
architecture of Emacspeak, see the <a href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/bc-emacspeak/publish-emacspeak-bc.html">chapter on Emacspeak</a> in the
book <a href="http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2007/07/emacspeak-and-beautiful-code.html">Beautiful Code</a> from O'Reilly.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Key Component: Text To Speech (TTS)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Emacspeak is a speech-subsystem for Emacs; it depends on an
external Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to produce speech. In 1994,
Digital Equipment released what would turn out to be the last in
the line of hardware DECTalk synthesizers, the DECTalk
Express. This was essentially an Intel 386with 1mb of flash
memory that ran a version of the DECTalk TTS software   —   to
date, it still remains my favorite Text-To-Speech engine.
At the time,  I also had a software version of the same engine
running on my DEC-Alpha workstation;  the desire to use either a
software or hardware solution to produce speech output defined
the Emacspeak speech-server architecture.
</p>

<p>
I went to IBM Research in 1999; this coincided with IBM releasing
a version of the Eloquennce TTS engine on Linux under the name
<i>ViaVoice Outloud</i>. My colleague Jeffrey Sorenson implemented an
early version of the Emacspeak speech-server for this engine using
the OSS API; I later updated it to use the ALSA library while on
a flight back to SFO from Boston in 2001. That is still the TTS
engine that is speaking as I type this article on my laptop. 
</p>

<p>
20 years on, TTS continues to be the weakest link on Linux; the
best available solution in terms of quality continues to be the
Linux port of Eloquence TTS available from Voxin in Europe for a
small price. Looking back across 20 years, the state of TTS on
Linux in particular and across all platforms in general continues
to be a disappointment; most of today's newer TTS engines are
geared toward mainstream use-cases where <i>naturalness</i> of the
voice tends to supercede intelligebility at higher
speech-rates. Ironically, modern TTS engines also give
applications far less control over the generated output   —   as a
case in point, I implemented <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/demo.html">Audio System For Technical Readings
(AsTeR)</a> in 1994 using the DECTalk; 20 years later, we implemented
<a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130604/t-v-ramans-audio-deja-vu-from-google-a-math-reading-system-for-the-web/">MathML support</a> in <a href="http://www.chromevox.com/">ChromeVox</a>  using Google TTS. In 2013, it turned
out to be difficult or impossible to implement the type of audio
renderings that were possible with the admittedly less-natural
sounding DECTalk!

<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> Emacspeak And Software Development</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
Version 0.01 of Emacspeak was written using IBM Screenreader on
a PC with a terminal emulator accessing a UNIX  workstation. But
in about 2 weeks, Emacspeak was already a better  environment for
developing Emacspeak in particular and software development in
general.  Here are a few highlights  in 1994 that made Emacspeak
a good software development environment, present-day users of
Emacspeak will see that that was just scratching the surface.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Audio formatting using voice-lock to provide aural syntax
highlighting.
</li>
<li>Succinct auditory icons to provide efficient feedback.
</li>
<li>Emacs' ability to navigate code structurally   — 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
as opposed to
  moving around by plain-text units such as characters, lines
  and words. S-Expressions are a major win!
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Emacs' ability to specialize behavior based on major and
minor modes.
</li>
<li>Ability to browse program code using  tags, and getting
fluent spoken feedback.
</li>
<li>Completion <b>everywhere</b>.
</li>
<li>Everything is searchable   —   this is a huge win when you
cannot see the screen.
</li>
<li>Interactive spell-checking using ISpell with continuous
spoken feedback augmented by  aural highlights.
</li>
<li>Running code compilation  and being able to jump to errors
with spoken feedback.
</li>
<li>Ability to easily move between email, document authoring and
programming   —   though this may appear trivial, it continues
to be one of Emacs' biggest wins.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Long-term Emacs users will recognize all of the above as  being
among the reasons why they do most things inside Emacs   —   there
is little that is Emacspeak specific in the above list   —   except
that Emacspeak was able to provide fluent, well-integrated
contextual feedback for all of these tasks. And that was a
game-changer given what I had had before Emacspeak. As a case in
point, I did not dare program in Python before  I speech-enabled
Emacs' Python-Mode; the fact that whitespace is significant in
Python made it difficult to program using a plain screenreader
that was unaware of the semantics of the underlying content being accessed.

<h3 id="sec-1-6"><span class="section-number-3">1.6</span> Emacspeak And Authoring Documents</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p>
In 1994, my prefered environment for authoring <b>all</b> documents
was <span class="underline">LaTeX</span> using the Auctex package. Later I started writing
either LaTeX or HTML using the appropriate support modes; today I
use <span class="underline">org-mode</span> to do most of my content authoring. Personally, I
have never been a fan of What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG )
authoring tools   —   in my experience that places an undue burden
on the author in terms of drawing attention away from the content
to focus on the final appearance. An added benefit  of creating
content in Emacs in the form of light-weight markup  is that the
content is long-lived   —   I can still usefully process and re-use
things I have written 20 years ago.
</p>

<p>
Emacs, with Emacspeak providing audio formatting and
context-specific feedback remains my environment of choice for
writing all forms of content ranging from simple email messages
to polished documents for print publishing. And it is worth
repeating that I <b>never</b> need to focus on what the content is
going to look like   —   that job is best left to the computer.
</p>

<p>
As an example of producing high-fidelity visual content, see
this write-up on <a href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/polyhedra/">Polyhedral Geometry</a> that  I published in 2000;
all of the content, including the drawings were created by me
using Emacs.

<h3 id="sec-1-7"><span class="section-number-3">1.7</span> Emacspeak And The Early Days Of The Web</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<p>
Right around the time that I was writing version 0.01 of
emacspeak, a far more significant software movement was under way
  —   the World Wide Web was moving from the realms of academia to
the mainstream world with the launch of NCSA Mosaic   — 
  and in
late 1994 by the first commercial Web browser in Netscape
Navigator. Emacs had always enabled integrated access to FTP
archives via package <i>ange-ftp</i>; in late 1993, William Perry
released Emacs-W3, a Web browser for Emacs written entirely in
Emacs Lisp. W3 was one of the first large packages to be
speech-enabled by Emacspeak   —   later it was the browser on which
I implemented the first draft of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/aural.html">Aural CSS
specification</a>. Emacs-W3 enabled many early innovations in the
context of providing non-visual access to Web content, including
audio formatting and structured content navigation; in summer of
1995, Dave Raggett and I outlined a few extensions to HTML Forms,
including the <span class="underline">label</span> element as a means of associating metadata
with interactive form controls in HTML, and many of these ideas
were prototyped in Emacs-W3 at the time. Over time, Emacs-W3 fell
behind the times   —   especially as the Web moved away from
cleanly structured HTML to a massive soup of unmatched tags. This
made parsing and error-correcting badly-formed HTML markup
expensive to do in Emacs-Lisp  —  
and performance suffered. To add
to this, mainstream users moved away because Emacs' rendering
engine at the time was not rich enough to provide the type of
visual renderings that users had come to expect. The advent of
DHTML, and JavaScript based Web Applications finally killed off
Emacs-W3 as far as most Emacs users were concerned.
</p>

<p>
But Emacs-W3 went through a revival on the emacspeak audio
desktop in late 1999 with the arrival of XSLT, and Daniel
Valliard's excellent implementation via the <span class="underline">libxml2</span> and
<span class="underline">libxslt</span> packages. With these in hand, Emacspeak was able to
hand-off the bulk of HTML error correction to the <span class="underline">xsltproc</span>
tool. The lack of visual fidelity didn't matter much for an
eyes-free environment; so Emacs-W3 continued to be a useful tool
for consuming large amounts of Web content that did not require
JavaScript support.
</p>

<p>
During the last 24 months, <span class="underline">libxml2</span> has been built into Emacs;
this means that you can now parse arbitrary HTML as found in the
wild without incuring a performance hit. This functionality was
leveraged first by package <span class="underline">shr</span> (Simple HTML Renderer) within
the <span class="underline">gnus</span> package for rendering HTML email; later, the author of
<span class="underline">gnus</span> and <span class="underline">shr</span> created a new light-weight HTML viewer called
<span class="underline">eww</span> that is now part of Emacs 24. the improved support for
variable pitch fonts and image embedding, Emacs is once again
able to provide visual renderings for a large proportion of
text-heavy Web content that is useful for mainstream Emacs users
to view at least some Web content within Emacs; during the last
year, I have added support within emacspeak to <a href="http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2014/05/emacspeak-eww-updates-for-complete.html">extend package
<span class="underline">eww</span></a> with support for DOM filtering and quick content
navigation.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-8"><span class="section-number-3">1.8</span> Audio Formatting: Generalizing Aural CSS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">
<p>
A key idea in Audio System For Technical Readings <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html">(AsTeR)</a> was the
use of various voice properties in combination with non-speech
auditory icons to create rich aural renderings. When I
implemented Emacspeak, I brought over the notion of audio
formatting to all buffers in Emacs by creating a <span class="underline">voice<sub>lock</sub></span>
module that paralleled Emacs' <span class="underline">font<sub>lock</sub></span> module. The visual
medium is far richer in terms of available fonts and colors as
compared to voice parameters available on TTS engines  — 
consequently, it did not make sense to directly map Emacs' <span class="underline">face</span>
properties to voice parameters. To aid in projecting visual
formatting onto auditory space, I created property <span class="underline">personality</span>
analogous to Emacs' <span class="underline">face</span> property that could be applied to
content displayed in Emacs; module <span class="underline">voice<sub>lock</sub></span> applied that
property appropriately, and the Emacspeak core handled the
details of mapping personality values to the underlying TTS
engine. 
</p>

<p>
The values used in property <span class="underline">personality</span> were abstract, i.e.,
they were independent of any given speech engine. Later in the
fall of 1995, I re-expressed these set of abstract voice
properties in terms of Aural CSS; the work was published as a
first draft toward the end of 1995, and implemented in Emacs-W3
in early 1996. Aural CSS was an appendix in the CSS-1.0
specification; later, it graduated to being its own module within
CSS-2.0.
</p>

<p>
Later in 1996, all of Emacs' <span class="underline">voice-lock</span> functionality was
re-implemented in terms of Aural CSS; the implementation has
stood the test of time in that as I added support for more TTS
engines, I was  able to implement engine-specific mappings of
Aural-CSS values. This meant that the rest of Emacspeak could
define various types of voices for use in specific contexts
without having to worry about individual TTS engines.
Conceptually, property <span class="underline">personality</span> can be thought of as holding
an <span class="underline">aural display list</span>  —   various parts of the system can
annotate pieces of text with relevant properties that finally get
rendered in the aggregate. 
This model also works well with the notion of Emacs overlays
where a moving overlay is used to temporarily highlight text that
has other context-specific properties applied to it.
</p>


<p>
Audio formatting as implemented in Emacspeak is extremely
effective when working with all types of content ranging from
richly structured mark-up documents (LaTeX, org-mode) and
formatted Web pages to program source code. Perceptually,
switching to audio formatted output feels like switching from a
black-and-white monitor to a rich color display. Today,
Emacspeak's audio formatted output is the only way I can
correctly write <span class="underline">else if</span> vs <span class="underline">elsif</span> in various programming
languages!

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-9"><span class="section-number-3">1.9</span> Conversational Gestures For The Audio Desktop</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-9">
<p>
By 1996, Emacspeak was the only piece of adaptive technology I
used; in fall of 1995, I had moved to Adobe Systems from DEC
Research to focus on enhancing the Portable Document Format (PDF)
to make PDF content repurposable. Between 1996 and 1998, I was
primarily focused on electronic document formats  —   I took this
opportunity to step back and evaluate what I had built as an
auditory interface within Emacspeak. This retrospect proved
extremely useful in gaining a sense of perspective and led to
formalizing the high-level concept of <i>Conversational Gestures</i>
as a means of thinking about user interfaces.
</p>

<p>
By now, Emacspeak was a complete environment  —   I formalized
what it provided under the moniker <i>Complete Audio Desktop</i>. The
fully integrated user experience allowed me to move forward with
respect to defining interaction models that were highly optimized
to eyes-free interaction  —   as an example, see how Emacspeak
interfaces with modes like <span class="underline">dired</span>. Emacs' integration with
<span class="underline">ispell</span> for spell checking, as well as its various completion
facilities ranging from minibuffer completion to other forms of
dynamic completion while typing text provided more opportunities
for creating innovative forms of eyes-free interaction. With
respect to what had gone before (and is still par for the course
as far as traditional screen-readers are concerned), these types
of highly dynamic interfaces present a challenge. For example,
consider handling a completion interface using a screen-reader
that is speaking the visual display. There is a significant
challenge in deciding <i>what to speak</i> e.g., when presented with a
list of completions, the currently typed text, and the default
completion, which of these should you speak, and in what order?
</p>

<p>
The problem gets harder when you consider that the underlying
semantics of these items is generally not available from
examining the visual presentation in a consistent manner. By
having direct access to the underlying information being
presented, Emacspeak had a leg up with respect to addressing the
higher-level question  —   when you do have access to this
information, how to you present it effectively in an eyes-free
environment? For this and many other cases of dynamic
interaction, a combination of audio formatting, auditory icons,
and the ability to synthesize succinct messages from a
combination of information items  —   rather than having to
forcibly speak each item as it is rendered visually provided for
highly efficient eyes-free interaction. So in 1997, I went the
next step in asking  —   given access to the underlying
infromation, is it possible to build effective eyes-free
interaction to highly interactive tasks? I picked <span class="underline">Tetris</span> as a
means of exploring this space, the result was an Emacspeak
extension to speech-enable module <span class="underline">tetris.el</span>. The details of
what was learnt were published as a paper in Assets 98, and
expanded as a chapter on Conversational Gestures in my book on
Auditory Interfaces; that book was in a sense a culmination of
stepping back and gaining a sense of perspective of what I had
build during this period. The work on Conversational Gestures
also helped in formalizing the abstract user interface layer that
formed part of the XForms work at the W3C.
</p>

<p>
Speech-enabling games for effective eyes-free interaction  has
proven highly educational. Interactive games are typically built to challenge
the user,  and if the eyes-free interface is inefficient,  you
just wont play the game —
 contrast this with a task that you <b>must</b> perform, where you're
likely to make do with a sub-optimal interface.  Over the years,
Emacspeak has come to include eyes-free interfaces to several
games including Tetris, SuDoKu, and of late the popular
2048-game. Each of these have in turn contributed to  enhancing
the interaction model in Emacspeak, and those innovations
typically make their way to the rest of the environment.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-10">
<p>
Streaming real-time audio on the Internet became a reality with
the advent of RealAudio in 1994; soon there were a large number
of media streams available on the Internet ranging from music
streams to live radio stations. But there was an interesting
twist — for the most part, all of these media streams expected
one to look at the screen, even though the primary content was
purely audio (streaming video hadn't arrived yet!). Starting in
1996, Emacspeak started including a variety of eyes-free
front-ends for accessing media streams. Initially, this was
achieved by building a wrapper around <span class="underline">trplayer</span> — a headless
version of RealPlayer; later I built Emacspeak module
<span class="underline">emacspeak-m-player</span> for interfacing with package <span class="underline">mplayer</span>. A
key aspect of streaming media integration in emacspeak is that
one can launch and control streams without ever switching away
from one's primary task; thus, you can continue to type email or
edit code while seamlessly launching and controlling media
streams. Over the years, Emacspeak has come to integrate with
Emacs packages like <span class="underline">emms</span> as well as providing wrappers for
<span class="underline">mplayer</span> and <span class="underline">alsaplayer</span> — collectively, these let you
efficiently launch all types of media streams, including
streaming video.
</p>

<p>
In the mid-90's, Emacspeak started including a directory of media
links to some of the more popular radio stations — primarily as a
means of helping users getting started — Emacs' ability to
rapidly complete directory and file-names turned out to be the
most effective means of quickly launching a radio station!

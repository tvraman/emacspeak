<h1>Epitaph:  Tilden  Labrador</h1>

<h2>Epitaph</h2>

<p>Tilden Labrador (TilTil) --- he loved the tinkling of bells --- was
born August 4, 2009. I first
met him on the morning  of  July 17, 2011
and he graduated from Guiding Eyes (at home) on Aug  5, 2011.</p>
<p>His pet name was Til-Til (he loved the sound of bells and would
jump up shoulder high if you rang a bell) --- and had a very gentle
personality. He  worked as a guide-dog for 11 years and 1 month
before going to sleep peacefully on September 3, 2022.</p>
<p>During his career, Tilden worked at Google Mountain View and
travelled to multiple Google offices including Seattle, Cambridge and
NYC to name a few. He also had the privilege of sharing at least 10
different desk locations on the Google MTv campus ranging from main
campus all the way to the far end of the Western Spiral Arm of the
Galaxy (AKA West Campus) and the opposite end on East Charleston.  He
travelled around the Google Campus proudly sporting his Google Badge,
but unlike his predecessor Bubbles, would wait if recalcitrant
Googlers blocked his way and look up at them gently as if to say <em>Why
dont you move out of my way please?</em>.
On the other hand, he was also the veritable sphinx in that if he
parked himself outsite the restroom to wait for me, he would look up
at all who  came close to say <em>Thou Shall Not Pass</em>.
He worked on a variety of
AI-powered projects including Google Accessibility, Smart Assistant,
and toward the end on Google Translate, all while bringing his
refreshingly Natural Intelligence to his primary job of path planning
and obstacle avoidance on the Google Campus --- and believe you me, it
takes a particularly intelligent dog to avoid obstacles that smart
Googlers can place in your way.   He attended most Smart Assistant
offsites with the claim <em>All of you have just a Smart Assistant;
But I'm a Smart AssistDog, and that is better, --- because you know, A
Dog is Bigger Than An Ant!</em>
In addition, Tilden, like Aster and
Bubbles before him, was also the mascot for <a

Desktop</a>; in addition, he  played the vital role of Press/Analyst
contact for just over 11 years.</p>

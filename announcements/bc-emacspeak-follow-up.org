* Background 

In 2007, I wrote a [[http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/bc-emacspeak/publish-emacspeak-bc.html][chapter on Emacspeak]] for the book [[http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510046.do][Beautiful Code
from OReilly]]. About a year later, I wrote an article called [[http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/thinking-of-math/][Thinking
Of Mathematics]]. This article is being written over 10 years later as
a consolidated follow-up to the afore-mentioned publications. The goal
is to further crystalize some of the lessons learnt over the duration
of project Emacspeak, while stepping back to think more broadly about
Software Engineering.

* Goals 

* Developing Robust Software Over  Time 

* Leverage Structure To Create And Organize Information

* Bushy Vs Deep Trees In Source Code 

* Avoiding The Least Common Denominator Effect 


* Defensive Coding To Maintain Long-Term Sanity

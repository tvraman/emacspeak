* Emacspeak And Speechdel  -*- mode:org -*-

** Background

[[http://emacspeak.sf.net][Emacspeak]] speech-enables Emacs by advising core emacs
functionality.  Speech services are provided by a simple
Emacspeak speech-server.  Additionally, Emacspeak implements
speech-extensions for popular emacs modules --- see the 
[[http://emacspeak.sf.net/applications.html][speech-enabled applications list]].

Emacspeak was first released in 1995, and then (as now), there
was limited speech access to the Linux GUI.  Therefore, to be
useful as a complete access solution, Emacspeak has always needed
to enable the user to *do everything* from within Emacs, not just
regular editing operations. As a case in point, emacspeak users
are probably one of the last remaining communities that use Emacs
for browsing the Web.

** Speech Dispatcher (SpeechD)

The idea of SpeechD --- peech Dispatcher as an intermediate layer
between speech clients and TTS engines was first floated sometime
in the late 90's.  Such a common layer is a laudible goal but is
something that takes time and effort to get right. Additionally,
you have the challenge of geting existing software e.g.,
emacspeak, to abandon their own speech abstraction and
re-implement against a supposedly more generic, but completely
untested and untried intermediate layer.

The developers of SpeechD initially incorporated some of the
Emacspeak code into an Emacs wrapper (speechdel) that called
SpeechD, but later decided to go their own way -- and present
[[http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd-el][speechdel]] is the result.

Like Emacspeak, speechdel uses Emacs Lisp's advice facility to
add spoken feedback to core editing commands; speech output is
produced by calling out to speech-dispatcher.

The summary of feature differences between Emacspeak and speechdel in the
next section is from examining the speechdel code-base; I have
not run speechdel since its dependency chain resulting from
speechd was difficult to resolve on my FC3 64bit machine.

** Emacspeak Features Not Found In SpeechDel

  1) Emacpeak implements Aural CSS [[http://www.w3.org/Press/1998/CSS2-REC][ACSS]], and uses it to  provides
     the aural analog of =font-lock=.

  2) Emacspeak provides pronunciation
     dictionaries. Pronunciations can be defined on a per-mode,
     per-buffer or per-directory basis. Directory and mode
     specific pronunciations are persisted across sessions. This
     allows Emacspeak to leverage Emacs' intelligence about the
     semantics of a given application; thus, you can have
     it say "p arrow x" for "p->x" when editing C
     code. Per-directory pronunciations are useful for reading
     electronic books. Per-buffer pronunciations are useful for
     succinctly speaking long lines of shell output e.g. when
     compiling complex software.

  3) By advising core Emacs functionality, Emacs modes work out
     of the box with Emacspeak. But in most cases, Emacspeak goes
     one step further by providing light-weight speech-modules
     that specialize spoken output for a given mode. As an
     example, advising next-line to speak the current line is
     sufficient to use =dired-mode= --- but having to listen to
     the entire line of dired output is not a pleasant
     experience. The dired-specific module in Emacspeak advises
     all interactive dired commands to speak the "right"
     information. As an another example, GUD interaction
     automatically speaks the line of source-code without leaving
     the *Gud* buffer.
     
  4) Emacspeak comes with many "Emacs Applets" for performing
     tasks that most users would perform outside of
     Emacs. Examples include playing CDs, playing multimedia
     streams etc. Fortunately, I have not had to write too many
     of these since there are always Emacs users other than
     myself who also create such Emacs applications --- so where
     Emacs applications already exist, I merely speech-enable
     them with a small set of advice definitions, and in some
     cases add a few additional interacive commands.

  5) Emacs applications are plentiful for most tasks; one
     exception is the Web. Since emacs/w3 development was
     abandoned sometime around 1998, I have added significant Web
     interaction functionality to Emacspeak using Emacs/W3 as the
     basis. Today, a lot of this has also been ported to
     Emacs/W3M thanks to other enthusiasts on the Emacspeak
     mailing list.  Examples include:

    1) WebSearch module --- prompts for query and processes
       response to focus on the results.

    2) XSLT pre-processing: Allows pre-processing of complex
       pages before rendering via W3. Used to enable *smart*
       screen-scrapers using XPath.

    3) URL-Tempaltes: Originally motivated by =webjump.el=, this
       provides url templates that enable easy access to a
       variety of Web tasks rangig from looking up flight times
       to listening to your favorite NPR or BBc show. Think early
       cut at a "Web Command Line in the minibuffer".

  6) Customization via Custom, including additional
     keymaps. Comes with additional keymap files for the Linux
     console to enable =hyper=, =super=, and =alt= prefix
     keymaps.

  7) Module emacspeak-wizards iplements a large collection of
     Emacs wizards that enable common tasks that you would
     otherwise perform at the shell e.g., checking display status
     on a laptop. The additional prefix keymaps come in handy!

  8)Finally, note that *all* modules (except the core) are loaded
  on demand.All code is compiled with =byte-compile-dynamic= set to
  =T=  and individual application-specific modules  are kept
  completely independent of one another. Given the size of the
  Emacspeak codebase, this is a  pre-requisite for both efficiency
  and developer sanity.
